<h4 id="0-physics-is-simple">0. Physics is simple!</h4>

<p><strong>This is the simplest class you will take in your university career.</strong> It is rather accurate to say that the content of this class consists of Newton’s law of motion $\vec F=m\vec a$, along with a little math (algebra, simple trigonometry, extremely simple calculus). That’s it.</p>

<p>This class won’t be easy, of course; the difficult aspect of this course will be learning to use these simple tools – the elementary principles governing forces and motion – to understand situations that vary from how to drive safely on ice, how to measure the speed of a bullet, how to throw a basketball so that it goes into the hoop, how a bicycle works, and so on.</p>

<p>Physics is a science of simplicity. It is the most reductionist of the sciences; the aim of physics is to reduce the world around us to its simplest parts, understand how they work, and then put them back together to understand the things they make up. Physics is difficult because understanding how these simple pieces combine to determine the behavior of larger systems requires cleverness, ingenuity, and problem-solving skills. The most difficult aspect of this course is learning to solve problems with simple tools. It’s like building things out of Legos: you’re supposed to build a rocketship, or a statue of Yoda, and all you have are these little bricks!</p>

<p>This is very different than the life sciences, where the difficulty lies in complexity: nature has built very complicated machines called “lizard” and “tree” and “physicist”, and it is up to biology to try to make sense of the complexity behind her creations. Biology is hard because you have to understand all of the different pieces that make up lizards and trees and physicists. But physics isn’t like that: in this class we have only objects and forces that act on them, and from that foundation you have to build up the solution to many different situations. That’s the power of physics: simple laws in combination drive everything around us.</p>

<p>So, if you’re stuck on a problem, think simple; that’s how physics works.</p>

<h4 id="1-reasoning-and-synthesis-not-memorization">1. Reasoning and synthesis, not memorization</h4>

<p>This course is emphatically not a class where you will come to lecture, sit there and listen to a presentation of some facts, and then repeat them back to us on exams. The laws of mechanics are very simple, and you could 
memorize them in an hour if you wanted. The challenging aspect of this class is the <em>application</em> of those
principles to understand the motion of physical systems – to take the principles of nature and, using mathematics
as a tool, synthesize them into an understanding of how a particular system behaves. 
You are not going to be learning a list of currently-accepted facts; you are going to be practicing skills and learning to see the universe as scientists see it.</p>

<h4 id="2-ask-for-help-early-and-often">2. Ask for help, early and often</h4>

<p>Since the difficult part of the course is the problem-solving aspect, it’s only natural that we are going to give you lots of help in solving problems, especially at first. Learning physics is most similar to learning to play
a sport or learning a musical instrument: it requires practice and the guidance of a coach. We do not expect that you can do all of the homework problems on your own; it is crucial that you ask for help in doing your homework. If you’re stuck on a homework problem, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Come to our office hours and ask, or make an appointment, or drop by my office (room 215)</li>
  <li>Ask on the Discord server (<a href="https://discord.gg/bngYwjZRHk">https://discord.gg/bngYwjZRHk</a>) – chances are someone will help you 
out right away</li>
  <li>Go to the Physics Clinic; you will find a TA, other students, and/or Walter there to help you.</li>
  <li>Ask a question in the lecture: if you’re stuck on something your peers probably are too, and will welcome your question. 
We <em>always</em> have time in lecture to answer questions about physics; don’t be intimidated by the size of the class.</li>
  <li>Ask your TA or coaches during recitation</li>
  <li>Ask your peers for help (and insist that they help you understand how to think about the problem, not just give you the answer)</li>
  <li>Write me, your coaches, or your TA an email.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again: it is <strong>intended that you will get stuck</strong>, just like no pianist plays a difficult piece perfectly the first time. The problem-solving skills in this course are things you have to practice, and we expect you to have to practice in order to make progress; come ask us for help, and we’ll guide you as you practice.</p>

<h4 id="3-learn-from-your-work">3. Learn from your work</h4>

<p>As you look at problems – whether you’re solving them the first time or reviewing for an exam – remember: it’s not enough to know the answer. You likely won’t see the same problems again.</p>

<p>It’s also not enough to know how to get the answer. Knowing how to get the answer – looking through the solution and understanding how each step follows logically from the last – is also not enough.</p>

<p>Instead, you should make sure you know how you know what to do to solve the problem. After you complete a problem, take just a few minutes to look back over it and ask yourself: what about this problem led me to the solution? Make sure you’re aware of what aspects of the problem make it solvable in a particular way. This will help you build a flexible toolkit of problem-solving skills, tools that will serve you well on the exams and in life.</p>

<p>We’ve chosen to give you only six to ten homework problems per week. We could give you more, and in fact if you want more practice problems there are more available in your textbook. This is because we intend for you to spend more time thinking about what each problem entails, and learning from them; our experience has shown that students who have to slog through 25 homework problems per week are less likely to actually think about the skills they’ve applied in each one, since homework becomes a grueling endurance challenge rather than an opportunity to learn physics. We’d much rather have you do the latter.</p>

<h4 id="4-this-is-not-a-math-class">4. This is not a math class</h4>
<p>In this class, you will use mathematics, but it is only a tool. Do not let yourself become a thrall to mathematics; this class is no more about mathematics than a class on Shakespeare is a class about words.</p>

<p>The laws of physics are written in the language of mathematics, but they describe things beyond math: the physical interactions between objects.</p>

<p>If you are stuck, resist the temptation to go leafing through your textbook looking for “the right equation to use”. Physics isn’t about equations; it’s about ideas and the ability to solve problems. Instead, put your pencil down and think: what is going on here? What principles are at work in this problem? How do I expect the system to move (or not move)? What things do I know, and what other things can I figure out from them? What does my intuition tell me should happen? What forces act on the objects? If you still can’t figure out how to proceed after thinking for a while and consulting your notes on problem-solving approaches, it’s a good time to ask for help.</p>

<p>The mathematics you will need for this class are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Algebra:
    <ul>
      <li>You will need the ability to solve a system of $N$ equations for $N$ unknowns using substitution</li>
      <li>You will need to know how to use the quadratic formula to find the roots of a quadratic equation</li>
      <li>There is guaranteed to be one problem on the first exam where you will need to use the quadratic formula</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Trigonometry:
    <ul>
      <li>You will need to know how to compute the legs of a right triangle given knowledge of its hypotenuse and one of its angles</li>
      <li>You will need to know how to compute the angles of a right triangle and the length of its hypotenuse given the lengths of the legs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Calculus:
    <ul>
      <li>You need to know the concepts of “derivative” (rate of change) and “integral” (cumulative effect / area under curve). If you are just now in Calculus I, don’t worry; it is no accident that Newton developed both mechanics and calculus, and we will teach you what you need to know. You won’t have to do any difficult derivatives or integrals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it.</p>

<h4 id="5-this-is-your-class-too">5. This is your class, too</h4>

<p>As part of this philosophy of inquiry and questioning, we welcome your input. If there is some aspect of physics that inspires or fascinates you, please ask; if you have feedback for us that will help you enjoy the class more, then please let us know.</p>

<h3 id="course-activities">Course Activities</h3>

<p><a id="recitations"></a></p>
<h4 id="recitations">Recitations</h4>

<p>Twice a week, you will have discussion sections led by your TA’s, assisted by a coaches from previous years of Physics 211. <em>These discussion sections are the most crucial 
part of this class</em>, since it’s there that you will do the hard and crucial work of practicing the skills you learn. Physics takes practice. It’s not something you only learn from a lecture;
it’s something you practice with a coach. In recitations, you’ll practice your skills in groups–learning from your peers, teaching them, and asking questions of the numerous
guides that are there to help you.</p>

<p>Recitation attendance and participation are graded. We will give you a grade based on how well we observe you learning alongside your group.</p>

<p>Before each in-class exam, you’ll take a group practice exam in recitation with your group. These practice exams are graded as well.</p>

<p>A further set of guidelines (incorporated into this syllabus) for recitation, and the homework you’ll submit during them, may be found at <a href="https://walterfreeman.github.io/phy211/recitation-guidelines.html">https://walterfreeman.github.io/phy211/recitation-guidelines.html</a></p>

<p><a id="readings"></a></p>
<h4 id="readings">Readings</h4>

<p>We will post assigned readings on the calendar before each class. (These may change during the semester based on our progress, but we
will let you know at least a week ahead of time.)</p>

<p><a id="checkins"></a></p>
<h4 id="weekly-check-ins">Weekly check-ins</h4>

<p>Each weekend, sometime between when you finish recitation on Friday and the next Monday at noon, I’d like you to spend 5-10 minutes filling out a Google Form telling me how
things are going – in particular, how well you are understanding the material from recitation, how well your groups are working, etc.</p>

<p>This is a chance for you to keep me updated on how things are going for you – both in our course and overall. I’ll base what we do the following week on your feedback. 
They’re due Monday at noon because this will give me time to incorporate your feedback into the Tuesday morning lectures and the design of the following week’s recitation material.</p>

<p>These check-ins <em>are</em> graded, but they aren’t intended to test your knowledge of physics. 
The grade for this amounts to “free credit” that you can earn by providing me useful feedback about how you are doing.</p>

<p><a id="lectures"></a></p>
<h4 id="lectures">Lectures</h4>

<p>We will alternate between presentation and practice. We will first introduce you to the new ideas we are studying
If you have done the reading ahead of class, these presentations will serve as review and enrichment.</p>

<p>We will also demonstrate for you the analytic processes involved in solving problems. <strong>I will always have time
to discuss your questions about the homework or recitation activities</strong>. Need hints on your homework? Ask.</p>

<p><strong>At any time during class, we encourage you to ask questions and make comments about physics</strong>. If you do not understand something, ask.</p>

<p><a id="homework"></a></p>
<h4 id="homework">Homework</h4>

<p>Homework in this class is designed as a tool to help you develop the problem-solving skills needed to understand physical situations on your own.</p>

<p>You will have an assignment due each week (more or less). We have found that fancy computer homework systems (Blackboard, Mastering Physics, or whatever else)
tend not to be as useful as good old pencil and paper.</p>

<p>We do not intend for you to work on these problems by yourself without help. 
The Physics Clinic is a great place to come to do your homework; you will likely find many of your peers there as well, along with 
tutors who can help you, and you can ask questions as they arise.</p>

<p>You can also discuss the homework in #homework-discussion on Discord with your peers.</p>

<p>Doing the homework thoughtfully and with an eye toward understanding “So how did I know what to do here?”, and working alongside your peers and instructors as you do it,
is the single best thing you can do in this class.</p>

<p>When writing your homework solutions, you must describe what you are doing in words, even if these descriptions are brief; <em>your solutions should not consist only of equations.</em> 
Show us what you are thinking and why you are doing what you’re doing; this will both help you learn and help us give you more partial credit if you understand what you’re doing but mess up the math. 
<strong>If you do not describe what you are doing and why, you will not get full credit for a solution, even if it is correct.</strong></p>

<p>You must submit each problem on a separate side of a page; this is to help us grade your work more easily, 
and will give the TA’s more time to help you learn physics – which is what we’d all prefer!</p>

<p>Two problems from each set will be graded fully (out of ten points); the rest will be quickly graded for completeness out of two. 
Your lowest homework set grade will be dropped.</p>

<p><a id="labs"></a></p>
<h4 id="labs">Labs</h4>

<p>You are enrolled in a lab. It is a separate course, with separate grades and TA’s. 
You may also ask your lab TA or Sam Sampere (smsamper@syr.edu). (You may, of course, ask 
any of us questions about the <em>physics</em> of things you do in lab.)</p>

<p>Another good place to ask about things in your lab is the #lab-discussion channel on Discord. Someone in
our class will likely know the answer!</p>

<h4 id="help-sessions-and-the-physics-clinic">Help Sessions and the Physics Clinic</h4>

<p>The Physics Clinic (room 112) is a place where you can go from 8am-9pm (or thereabouts) to work with other people,
along with professional tutors, to learn physics. We hope you’ll find it a welcoming and friendly place! 
I’ll be holding help sessions there (“office hours”), when you can come talk to me about anything; even when
I am not there, there will almost always be someone on hand to help you.
If you have questions or suggestions, need help with your homework or with studying, or just want to chat, this is a great opportunity.</p>

<p>We have a few leniencies that we will apply to this rubric:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The first time you miss a group practice exam, its grade will be replaced with the same percentage you earn on the corresponding individual exam, if you
missed the group practice exam for an excused reason. 
To do this, you must tell your TA why you missed the group exam, and do so in advance if possible. You must also
tell your group that you will be absent – this is a professional courtesy to them!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your lowest exam grade, your lowest homework set grade, your lowest weekly check-in, and your four lowest recitation participation days will be dropped.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note however that students with an unusually low recitation participation grade for any given unit, or 
who demonstrate that they don’t understand this material on the final, will not be eligible to drop the
corresponding exam at our discretion. (Basically: if you bomb an exam, it won’t count against you
<em>if and only if</em> you make sure you learn that material before the final.)</p>

<p>If you don’t believe the grades on something are correct, see below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you believe that the grade you have earned on something is incorrect, you should notify us within a week
of when we post those grades to Blackboard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to appeal the grading of any homework or exam problem, you must be prepared to solve the problem
fully on the chalkboard with no notes, and then explain how the solution you originally gave demonstrates more
knowledge of physics than the grader thought. We can only give you a grade based on the knowledge and skill
your original answer demonstrated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grades for answers with no clear explanation given (text or well-organized algebra that explains itself)
are not subject to appeal.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the term, we will assign you a letter grade based on the percentage you have earned, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A : &gt;88</li>
  <li>A-: 80-88</li>
  <li>B+: 75-80</li>
  <li>B : 70-75</li>
  <li>B-: 65-70</li>
  <li>C+: 62-64</li>
  <li>C : 58-62</li>
  <li>C-: 55-58</li>
  <li>D : 50-55</li>
  <li>F : less than 50</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="exams"></a></p>
<h4 id="exams">Exams</h4>

<p>There will be three exams and a final on the dates shown on the course schedule.</p>

<p>For all of the exams, you may bring one piece of paper with anything you have handwritten on it with a pencil or pen.
You may not bring printouts or anything someone else has written. (If you have a disability that impairs your ability
to write, you may bring one page of notes that you have prepared yourself in a way accessible to you.)</p>

<p>You may use a calculator to do arithmetic, evaluate trigonometric functions, and so on. In general, you may use any
“scientific” or “graphing” calculator, but may not use a calculator that will do symbolic manipulation (i.e. do 
algebra for you).</p>

<p>Makeup exams will generally not be given; this is why we allow you to drop your lowest exam grade. 
In emergency situations we may arrange for a makeup exam as part of a broader accommodation; see the
section below for details.</p>

<!--
For all of the exams, you may refer to

* the OpenStax textbook for our class
* any notes you have yourself prepared
* any materials belonging to our class, such as class notes, review guides, or solution videos

You may *not* use:

* other materials on the internet 

You may bring a double-sided page of 
handwritten notes, a nonprogrammable calculator, and writing implements. (Calculators that graph functions
or solve equations symbolically are not allowed.) Note that your notes must be *handwritten* by you; photocopies of 
someone else's notes are not allowed. (If you have a disability that impairs your ability to write, then you may 
prepare your notes yourself using means accessible to you.)
 **Cellphones,
smartwatches, and the like may not be used during exams for any reason. Using these devices is presumptive 
evidence of academic dishonesty. If, due to an emergency situation, you require an exception to this, notify
me or a proctor before the exam starts.**

Makeup exams will not be given except in extreme circumstances involving serious disabling illness (not just a cold),
family emergency, or events of singular
importance to your personal life that occur on inflexible dates (e.g. your sibling is getting married). If you
must miss an exam for such a reason, notify one of the professors or the head TA as far in advance as possible. We may ask for
documentation. We may either:

<p><a id="incompletes"></a></p>

<h4 id="incompletes">Incompletes</h4>

<p>A grade of “incomplete” may be given to any student who is unable to complete the course material by to the end of the semester due to
unavoidable problems outside his or her control. This is a “grade pending” status that allows you to finish up the course in the future and then
receive a grade. In general, any student who is unable to meaningfully participate in class for a period of two weeks or more due to</p>

<ul>
  <li>serious illness or injury, physical or mental;</li>
  <li>caregiving for the serious illness of a family member;</li>
  <li>legal involvement or proceedings;</li>
  <li>or international issues</li>
</ul>

<p>is eligible to take an incomplete in the course. If you think that you may need to take an incomplete, please contact us as soon as possible. We will
ask for documentation of your situation.</p>

<p>In general, students may <em>only</em> take an incomplete if they have finished a substantial portion of the course (two of the four units) with a grade of C+ or better.</p>

<p><a id="policy"></a></p>

<hr />
<p><a id="integrity"></a></p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h3>

<p>While you are encouraged to discuss your homework with your peers and collaborate with them on solving our problems, 
all work you submit must reflect your own understanding and be a product of your own effort. Submitting any work that you do not understand and cannot explain, or that
is a result of wholesale copying, will be considered academic dishonesty. Please don’t let this discourage you from working on your homework with your peers.
That is exactly what you <em>should</em> do! But <em>copying someone’s work</em> is different than <em>working together with them</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, you are not allowed to post solutions to the homework on the Internet or solicit them in exchange for money. In particular
posting solutions to or copying solutions from Chegg or any other websites that charge students a fee or otherwise monetize access to that material
is an extremely serious breach of the Academic Integrity Policy and may result in your suspension or expulsion from SU.</p>

<p>In general:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <strong>homework assignments</strong>, you may consult any general references and people you like, so long as you are not soliciting solutions to copy. Your solution must be your own work, and you must understand everything you submit.</li>
  <li>for <strong>group quizzes</strong>, you may work with the other members in your group. You must understand everything you
submit. Teaching staff (coaches and TA’s) will often provide assistance during your recitation if you forget something;
we will, for instance, tell you what the quadratic formula is if you forget.</li>
  <li>for <strong>exams</strong>, you may bring one page of handwritten notes, plus a calculator that doesn’t do algebra for you. You may not use any other electronic devices (smartphones, smartwatches,
earphones), and may not consult with anyone other than teaching staff during the exam.</li>
</ul>

<!--
For **the paper**, we expect you to do research and consult other people for their ideas, but you must write the paper yourself. (You should, of course, solicit feedback on your writing and ideas
from your peers and from people like the Writing Center!) We will provide more detail about the expectations for the paper when we assign it.
In your paper, you must show clearly which text is original to you, which reflects ideas which you found elsewhere but have digested and expressed in your own words, and which text is a direct quote from someone else’s words. You must cite any references that you use. (You do not need to cite anything from the course textbook, notes, or lectures.) If you consult a source for information, you should 
indicate the source of that information using an in-text citation or footnote. We don’t care what citation style you use.

Direct quotes must be indicated.
This is done by either blockquoting the other writer’s text or by putting it in quotation marks, with a citation immediately following. 
In general, however, you should use direct quotes only sparingly in your writing.

**A note on "paraphrasing":** Near-direct paraphrases, in which you take the organization and narrative of someone else's writing and merely replace words with synonyms, reorder words, omit sentences or phrases,
and the like, are never a good idea. The point of writing is to have original thoughts and communicate them clearly; if you are merely taking someone else's thoughts and repainting them, you are
not learning anything about either science or writing. The name for this sort of thing is _substitution plagiarism_; as the name implies, it's a type of plagiarism. We want you to tell your _own_
story.
-->

<p>We reserve the right to seek a sanction of course failure for any instance of academic dishonesty.</p>

<p><em>(The following is boilerplate from the University)</em></p>

<p>Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as
a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines
our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the
integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their
responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about
university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate
citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and
assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other
verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students
from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written
authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in
violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and
non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is
offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. SU
students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic
integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by
them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice.</p>

<h3 id="students-with-disabilities-and-other-access-challenges">Students with disabilities and other access challenges</h3>

<p>Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation.  If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course, please contact us to discuss accommodations we can make to ensure that the class is accessible to you, or collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss disability-related accommodations with CDR, please visit their website 
at <a href="http://disabilityservices.syr.edu">disabilityservices.syr.edu</a>, visit them in person in Room 309 of 8047 University Avenue, or call (315) 443-4498, TDD: (315) 443-1371 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting accommodations. CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible.</p>

<p>CDR is one of the most helpful offices on campus. They coordinate academic accommodations to students who have short-term illnesses (physical or mental). If you are injured or ill and need
academic accommodations beyond short-term due date extensions for PHY211, we will likely design those accommodations for you in collaboration with CDR.</p>

<p>If there are other things presenting access challenges to you in our class – family situations, health challenges, etc. – please 
talk to me as soon as possible. We will do whatever we must to ensure that you have every opportunity to gain skills in physics and be assessed on those skills fairly.</p>

<p><a id="absences"></a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="absences-makeup-work-and-academic-accommodations">Absences, makeup work, and academic accommodations</h3>

<p>We anticipate that students will occasionally miss class or submission deadlines for a variety of reasons.
We recognize that you have many things in your life that may supercede our class: 
events occurring on inflexible dates that are of singular
importance to your education, your family, stewardship of your health and the health of others, your career, your 
religious faith or life stance, or your participation in the democratic process or civic discourse. You might also 
miss class due to an unexpected emergency such as a car accident.</p>

<p><strong>If you miss an isolated lecture class</strong>, you may be able to catch up during the recitation immediately following the class you miss. You are always welcome to come to 
my office hours for help (and should do so).</p>

<p><strong>If you are late turning in a homework assignment</strong>, you should describe the reason it is late to your TA and get their permission to turn it in late. 
(We will generally grant homework extensions for the reasons outlined above or in other situations where granting a homework extension will help you learn
physics.) We will not accept homework more than three days late without a very good reason.</p>

<p><strong>If you miss a group quiz</strong> for a good reason (detailed above), we will replace its grade with the grade you get on the corresponding exam held the next week.
To be eligible to do this, unless the situation is an emergency, you must contact your GTA and Walter and explain the reason for your absence and get it approved ahead of time, and then
contact your group and let them know that you will not be able to help them with their work. <em>(You may do this once.)</em></p>

<p><strong>If you miss an exam</strong>, we will drop it as your lowest exam grade. <em>(You may do this once.)</em></p>

<p><strong>If you are falling significantly behind</strong> – if you have missed a week of recitation,
if you are seriously ill, if you have personal problems that prevent you from doing work for an extended period, etc. – we will need to
make arrangements during office hours and design an accommodation specifically for your situation. To be eligible for this sort of thing,
you must come talk to us promptly once you fall behind so we can help you get back on track; do not tell me in May why you were unable
to do your homework in March. We will create a syllabus modification accommodation (including extended due dates or whatever else)
that is appropriate to your situation.</p>

<!--


We anticipate that students will occasionally need to miss class for events occurring on inflexible dates that are of singular 
importance to their education, their families, their health or the health of others, their careers, their
religious faith or life stance, or their participation in the democratic process. 
These absences will be excused (i.e. missing recitation or class for these reasons will not count against your 
participation grade).

These excused absences are generally: 

* Religious observances (declared in advance on MySlice during the first two weeks of class)

* Personal events of equal solemnity to major religious observances occurring on inflexible dates. This includes weddings and commitment ceremonies of close family members, funerals, and the like.

* Caregiving duties for sick family members

* For students off campus, severe disruptions to your living situation that prevent you from attending recitation

* Illness or injury that is sufficiently severe to prevent you from attending recitation 

* Attendance at academic events (for instance, travel to an academic conference, participation in a seminar, performance in the marching band or a student ensemble, etc.).

* Attendance at a professional development opportunity (a career fair, a job interview, a ROTC event) or work emergencies

* Participation in the political process (canvassing for a campaign, attendance at a scheduled demonstration or a spontaneous one in response to developing events)

If you must miss recitation for such a reason, please notify your recitation instructor in advance if possible. You may make up your missed recitation the following week. If you must miss an
*exam* for such a reason, please talk to one of the professors to make arrangements.



Absence from class for recreational activities unrelated to academics, professional development, or solemn family life will not be excused; these absences will count against your four dropped recitation participation grades. Unexcused absences include:

* Any Greek Life event (any activity put on by a Greek-letter organization, with the exception of purely academic honor societies that accept all students regardless of gender and do not maintain a house)

* Any athletic event (as an athlete or a spectator), whether NCAA-sanctioned or not. (If you must miss an *exam* for a NCAA-sponsored athletic event, come talk to us; we may be able to make arrangements for you to take it on the road.)

* Weather (unless you are a commuter student who cannot get to campus safely or campus is closed)
