### Course philosophy 

#### 0. Physics is simple!

**This is the simplest class you will take in your university career.** It is accurate to say that the content of this class consists of Newton's law of motion $\vec F=m\vec a$, along with a little math (algebra, simple trigonometry, extremely simple calculus). That's it.

This doesn't mean this class will be easy, of course; the difficult aspect of this course will be learning to use these simple tools -- the elementary principles governing forces and motion -- to understand situations that vary from how to drive safely on ice, how to measure the speed of a bullet, how to throw a basketball so that it goes into the hoop, how a bicycle works, and so on.

Physics is a science of simplicity. It is the most reductionist of the sciences; the aim of physics is to reduce the world around us to its simplest parts, understand how they work, and then put them back together to understand the things they make up. Physics is difficult because understanding how these simple pieces combine to determine the behavior of larger systems requires cleverness, ingenuity, and problem-solving skills. The most difficult aspect of this course is learning to solve problems with simple tools. It's like building things out of Legos: you're supposed to build a rocketship, or a statue of Yoda, and all you have are these little bricks!

This is very different than the life sciences, where the difficulty lies in complexity: nature has built very complicated machines called "lizard" and "tree" and "physicist", and it is up to biology to try to make sense of the complexity behind her creations. Biology is hard because you have to understand all of the different pieces that make up lizards and trees and physicists. But physics isn't like that: in this class we have only objects and forces that act on them, and from that foundation you have to build up the solution to many different situations. That's the power of physics: simple laws in combination drive everything around us.

So, if you're stuck on a problem, think simple; that's how physics works. 

#### 1. Reasoning and skill-building, not memorization

This course is emphatically not a class where you will come to lecture, sit there and listen to a presentation of some facts, and then repeat them back to us on exams. The laws of mechanics are very simple, and you could 
memorize them in an hour if you wanted. The challenging aspect of this class is the *application* of those
principles to understand the motion of physical systems -- to take the principles of nature and, using mathematics
as a tool, synthesize them into an understanding of how a particular system behaves. 
You are not going to be learning a list of currently-accepted facts; you are going to be practicing skills and learning to see the universe as scientists see it.

#### 2. Ask for help, early and often

Since the difficult part of the course is developing problem-solving skills, it's only natural that we are going to give you lots of help in solving problems, especially at first. Learning physics is most similar to learning to play
a sport or learning a musical instrument: it requires practice and the guidance of a coach. We do not expect that you will always be able to do all of the homework problems on your own; 
it is crucial that you ask for help in doing your homework. If you're stuck on a homework problem, you can:

- Come to our office hours and ask, or make an appointment, or drop by my office (room 215)
- Ask on the Discord server (invite available on Blackboard) -- chances are someone will help you 
out right away
- Go to the Physics Clinic; you will find a TA, other students, and/or Walter there to help you.
- Ask a question in the lecture: if you're stuck on something your peers probably are too, and will welcome your question. 
We *always* have time in lecture to answer questions about physics; don't be intimidated by the size of the class.
- Ask your TA or coaches during recitation
- Ask your peers for help (and insist that they help you understand how to think about the problem, not just give you the answer)
- Write me, your coaches, or your TA an email.

Again: it is **intended that you will get stuck**, just like no pianist plays a difficult piece perfectly the first time. The problem-solving skills in this course are things you have to practice, and we expect you to have to practice in order to make progress; come ask us for help, and we'll guide you as you practice.

#### 3. Learn from your work

As you look at problems -- whether you're solving them the first time or reviewing for an exam -- remember: it's not enough to know the answer. You likely won't see the same problems again.

It's also not enough to know how to get the answer. Knowing how to get the answer -- looking through the solution and understanding how each step follows logically from the last -- is also not enough.

Instead, you should make sure you know how you know what to do to solve the problem. After you complete a problem, take just a few minutes to look back over it and ask yourself: what about this problem led me to the solution? Make sure you're aware of what aspects of the problem make it solvable in a particular way. This will help you build a flexible toolkit of problem-solving skills, tools that will serve you well on the exams and in life.

We've chosen to give you only six to ten homework problems per week. We could give you more, and in fact if you want more practice problems there are more available in your textbook. This is because we intend for you to spend more time thinking about what each problem entails, and learning from them; our experience has shown that students who have to slog through 25 homework problems per week are less likely to actually think about the skills they've applied in each one, since homework becomes a grueling endurance challenge rather than an opportunity to learn physics. We'd much rather have you do the latter. 

#### 4. This is not a math class
In this class, you will use mathematics, but it is only a tool. Do not let yourself become a thrall to mathematics; this class is no more about mathematics than a class on Shakespeare is a class about words.

The laws of physics are written in the language of mathematics, but they describe things beyond math: the physical interactions between objects.

If you are stuck, resist the temptation to go leafing through your textbook looking for "the right equation to use". Physics isn't about equations; it's about ideas and the ability to solve problems. Instead, put your pencil down and think: what is going on here? What principles are at work in this problem? How do I expect the system to move (or not move)? What things do I know, and what other things can I figure out from them? What does my intuition tell me should happen? What forces act on the objects? If you still can't figure out how to proceed after thinking for a while and consulting your notes on problem-solving approaches, it's a good time to ask for help.

The mathematics you will need for this class are:

- Algebra:
	- You will need the ability to solve a system of $N$ equations for $N$ unknowns using substitution
	- You will need to know how to use the quadratic formula to find the roots of a quadratic equation 
	- There is guaranteed to be one problem on the first exam where you will need to use the quadratic formula
- Trigonometry:
	- You will need to know how to compute the legs of a right triangle given knowledge of its hypotenuse and one of its angles
	- You will need to know how to compute the angles of a right triangle and the length of its hypotenuse given the lengths of the legs
- Precalculus: 
	- You need to be able to relate the shape of a graph to statements about its slope

If you don't have any of these skills, that's okay! You can tell us (or we'll figure that out from the math preassessment) and get you extra help through the assistance program.

#### 5. This is your class, too

As part of this philosophy of inquiry and questioning, we welcome your input. If there is some aspect of physics that inspires or fascinates you, please ask; if you have feedback for us that will help you enjoy the class more, then please let us know.

<a id="assistance"></a>

### Focused assistance program

We believe that anyone can understand physics. It does not require any special talent or gift; it requires only hard work and persistent effort. 
There is never shame in "not understanding something yet".

Everyone's progress in learning physics is different. We all begin this journey with different background in mathematics, and we all learn physics
skills unevenly. This class is designed to give you multiple avenues and times to learn each skill. However, the same exercise program doesn't always
work for everyone, and so we are trialing something new this year.

I am working with Brendan Parlee, a physics major focusing on education, to develop a program designed to identify when individual students need extra
help to learn some skill, whether mathematical or physical, and get them that help. Much of what we do will be behind the scenes. The ways that will affect
you are:

* You'll see us taking notes during recitation (not just about things you need help with, but also things you are doing well at!)
* We will invite people who need extra practice at particular skills to come to study sessions designed to help you learn those skills
* We may customize homework assignments for students to focus on the skills that would benefit them the most to practice
* Half of your final exam will consist of "second chances" at previous skills you had trouble with on prior exams

 <a id="material"></a>

### Learning Objectives

After taking this class, you will be able to:

* Use kinematics to describe motion:
  * Incorporate physical units (meters, seconds, and so on) into algebraic and arithmetic statements
  * Translate between verbal, graphical, algebraic, and numerical descriptions of an object's motion
  * Given a description of an object's acceleration, create a description of how its position and velocity change, or vice versa
  * Use vectors to describe motion in two and three dimensions, and use trigonometry to manipulate them

* Use Newton's second and third laws to relate forces to motion:
  * Identify the forces that act on the objects present in a variety of physical situations
  * Describe the basic properties of the forces of tension, friction, gravity, and normal forces
  * Using Newton's second law, construct mathematical relations between those forces and the objects' motion
  * Identify constraints on those forces and on objects' motion based on Newton's third law and the geometry of the situations at hand
  * Describe the forces required to cause an object to move in uniform circular motion
  * Use the previous skills to predict how an object will move in any given situation, and the forces involved in its motion

* Make use of conservation laws in physics:
  * Use conservation of momentum to solve problems that involve collisions and explosions
  * Use the work-energy theorem and conservation of energy to determine properties of the motion of systems to which they apply, and recognize which systems those are
  * Construct analogies between momentum and angular momentum, and rotational and translational kinetic energy 
  * Use conservation of energy to solve problems in which objects rotate as well as translate
  * Use conservation of angular momentum to solve problems involving collisions with rotating objects, or objects that change shape while rotating

* Analyze rotating systems:
  * Describe the relationship between the forces that act on an object and the torque they apply about any given axis
  * Describe the relationship between the torque applied to an object and its angular acceleration
  * Use both $\vec F=m\vec a$ and $\tau = I \alpha$ in tandem to predict the motion of objects that both translate and rotate

<!--
* (If we have time) Relate normal modes to acoustics:
  * Define and relate the wavelength, wave speed, and frequency of traveling waves
  * Quantitatively analyze the normal modes ("harmonics") of e.g. a guitar string or organ pipe
  * Qualitatively relate these ideas to analysis of the normal modes of a 2D or 3D cavity

* Engage in scientific reasoning:
  * Describe the basics of scientific integrity and the properties of both honest scientific arguments and dishonest pseudoscientific claims
  * Critique (pseudo)scientific claims that are made in bad faith, and describe the problems with them
  * Critically examine sound and unsound scientific claims that seek to overturn preexisting consensus. In particular:
    * Describe the primacy of empirical measurements in evaluating scientific claims
    * Critique flawed arguments that fail to address empirical data 
    * Critique flawed arguments that fail to address the broader framework of physical laws of nature
    * Critique flawed arguments that focus on the identities of the people involved, rather than their data and logic -->

### Course Activities 

<a id="recitations"></a>
#### Recitations

Twice a week, you will have discussion sections led by your TA's, assisted by a coaches from previous years of Physics 211. *These discussion sections are the most crucial 
part of this class*, since it's there that you will do the hard and crucial work of practicing the skills you learn. Physics takes practice. It's not something you only learn from a lecture;
it's something you practice with a coach. In recitations, you'll practice your skills in groups--learning from your peers, teaching them, and asking questions of the numerous
guides that are there to help you.

Recitation is not a supplement to lecture. It's the other way around: lecture exists to prepare you for the practice you'll get in recitation, and to debrief what you did in recitation.

Recitation attendance and participation are graded. We will give you a grade based on how well we observe you learning alongside your group. 

Before each in-class exam, you'll take a group practice exam in recitation with your group. These practice exams are graded as well.

A further set of guidelines (incorporated into this syllabus) for recitation, and the homework you'll submit during them, may be found at <a href="https://walterfreeman.github.io/phy211/recitation-guidelines.html">https://walterfreeman.github.io/phy211/recitation-guidelines.html</a>

<a id="textbook"></a>
#### Readings

We will post correspondence between each day's class and textbook sections. (These may change during the semester based on our progress, but we
will let you know at least a week ahead of time.) However, many students do very well in this class without reading the textbook; most students learn
the material primarily from the homework and recitation exercises.

<a id="lectures"></a>
#### Lectures

We will alternate between presentation and practice. We will first introduce you to the new ideas we are studying
If you have done the reading ahead of class, these presentations will serve as review and enrichment. 

We will also demonstrate for you the analytic processes involved in solving problems. **I will always have time
to discuss your questions about the homework or recitation activities**. Need hints on your homework? Ask.

**At any time during class, we encourage you to ask questions and make comments about physics**. If you do not understand something, ask. 

<a id="homework"></a>
#### Homework

Homework in this class is designed as a tool to help you develop the problem-solving skills needed to understand physical situations on your own.

You will have an assignment due each week (more or less). We have found that fancy computer homework systems (Blackboard, Mastering Physics, or whatever else)
tend not to be as useful as good old pencil and paper. Also they cost money and everyone hates them.

We do not intend for you to work on these problems by yourself without help. 
The Physics Clinic is a great place to come to do your homework; you will likely find many of your peers there as well, along with 
tutors who can help you, and you can ask questions as they arise.

You can also discuss the homework in #homework-discussion on Discord with your peers.

Doing the homework thoughtfully and with an eye toward understanding "So how did I know what to do here?", and working alongside your peers and instructors as you do it,
is the single best thing you can do in this class.

When writing your homework solutions, you must describe what you are doing in words, even if these descriptions are brief; *your solutions should not consist only of equations.* 
Show us what you are thinking and why you are doing what you're doing; this will both help you learn and help us give you more partial credit if you understand what you're doing but mess up the math. 
**If you do not describe what you are doing and why, you will not get full credit for a solution, even if it is correct.**

Two problems from each set will be graded fully (out of ten points); the rest will be quickly graded for completeness out of two. 

<a id="labs"></a>
#### Labs

You are enrolled in a lab. It is a separate course, with separate grades and TA's. 
You may also ask your lab TA or Sam Sampere (smsamper@syr.edu). (You may, of course, ask 
any of us questions about the *physics* of things you do in lab.)

You should ask your lab TA or Tomasz Skwarnicki (the lab professor) questions about lab.

Another good place to ask about things in your lab is the #lab-discussion channel on Discord. Someone in
our class will likely know the answer!

<a id="help"></a>
#### Help Sessions and the Physics Clinic

The Physics Clinic (room 112) is a place where you can go during the day to work with other people,
along with professional tutors, to learn physics. We hope you'll find it a welcoming and friendly place! 
I'll be holding help sessions there ("office hours"), when you can come talk to me about anything; even when
I am not there, there will almost always be someone on hand to help you.
If you have questions or suggestions, need help with your homework or with studying, or just want to chat, this is a great opportunity.

### Grading  


| Item                         |            Date           | Points            |
|------------------------------|:-------------------------:|------------------:|
| Homework                     | Due throughout            |        Around 30 each; around 240 in total  |
| Exam 1                       | 7 February                |             100   |
| Exam 2                       | 28 February               |             100   |
| Exam 3                       | 4 April                   |             100   |
| Final Exam                   | 8 May, 3PM-5PM            |             100 plus extra credit   |
| Recitation participation     | Throughout the semester   |  5 each; around 125 in total   |
| Group practice exams         | Prior to each exam        | 50 each; 150 in total  |

We have a few leniencies that we will apply to this rubric:

* The first time you miss a group practice exam, if you missed it for a good reason, its grade will be replaced with the same percentage you earn on the corresponding individual exam.
To do this, you must tell your TA why you missed the group exam, and do so in advance if possible. You must also
tell your group that you will be absent -- this is a professional courtesy to them!

* Your final exam will consist of two parts. Part 1 of your final exam will be three questions from the material we have covered since Exam 3.
Part 2 of your final exam will consist of a "second chance" to demonstrate proficiency in topics that you didn't understand
during an earlier exam. This will vary from student to student, so each person's final exam will be different. However, in
each case, every student will get the same chance to earn credit back on topics they didn't understand at first.

* We do not "drop lowest" of anything, although recitation participation will be scaled such that students with
a few absences will not lose much credit. You may turn one homework assignment in up to a week late by writing
"This is my one late homework set" on top of it and bringing it to recitation.

If you don't believe the grades on something are correct:

* If you believe that the grade you have earned on something is incorrect, you should notify us within a week
of when we post those grades to Blackboard or return the graded work to you.

* If you want to appeal the grading of any homework or exam problem, you must be prepared to solve the problem
fully on the chalkboard with no notes, and then explain how the solution you originally gave demonstrates more
knowledge of physics than the grader thought. We can only give you a grade based on the knowledge and skill
your original answer demonstrated, but we expect you to fully understand the material before approaching us 
with an appeal.

* The grades for answers with no clear explanation given (text or well-organized algebra that explains itself)
are not subject to appeal. 

At the end of the term, we will assign you a letter grade based on the percentage you have earned, as follows:

- A : >88
- A-: 80-88
- B+: 75-80
- B : 70-75
- B-: 65-70
- C+: 62-64
- C : 58-62
- C-: 55-58
- D : 50-55
- F : less than 50

Your final grade will reflect your demonstrated skill in physics; this is the only thing we can consider in
assigning final grades. 

<a id="exams"></a>
#### Exams

There will be three exams and a final on the dates shown on the course schedule. 

For all of the exams, you may bring one piece of paper with anything you have handwritten on it with a pencil or pen.
You may not bring printouts or anything someone else has written. (If you have a disability that impairs your ability
to write, you may bring one page of notes that you have prepared yourself in a way accessible to you.)

You may use a calculator to do arithmetic, evaluate trigonometric functions, and so on. In general, you may use any
"scientific" or "graphing" calculator, but may not use a calculator that will do symbolic manipulation (i.e. do 
algebra for you). 
<a id="incompletes"></a>

#### Incompletes

A grade of "incomplete" may be given to any student who is unable to complete the course material by to the end of the semester due to
unavoidable problems outside his or her control. This is a "grade pending" status that allows you to finish up the course in the future and then
receive a grade. In general, any student who is unable to meaningfully participate in class for a period of two weeks or more due to

* serious illness or injury, physical or mental;
* caregiving for the serious illness of a family member;
* legal involvement or proceedings;
* or international issues

is eligible to take an incomplete in the course. If you think that you may need to take an incomplete, please contact us as soon as possible. We will
ask for documentation of your situation.

In general, students may *only* take an incomplete if they have finished a substantial portion of the course (two of the four units) with a grade of B- or better. 

<a id="policy"></a>

---
<a id="integrity"></a>
### Academic integrity

While you are encouraged to discuss your homework with your peers and collaborate with them on solving our problems, 
all work you submit must reflect your own understanding and be a product of your own effort. 
Submitting any work that you do not understand and cannot explain, or that
is a result of wholesale copying, will be considered academic dishonesty. Please don't let this discourage you from working on your homework with your peers.
That is exactly what you *should* do! But *copying someone's work* is different than *working together with them*. 

You are not allowed to post solutions to the homework on the Internet or solicit them in exchange for money. In particular
posting solutions to or copying solutions from Chegg, Bartleby, StudyX or any other websites that charge students a fee 
or otherwise monetize access to that material is an extremely serious breach of the Academic Integrity Policy and may 
result in your suspension or expulsion from SU. 

In general:

* for **homework assignments**, you may consult any general references and people you like, so long as you are not soliciting solutions to copy. 
Your solution must be your own work, and you must understand everything you submit. If you submit homework solutions that you have copied and don't understand, 
it will probably _lower_ your grade in the end, since we won't be able to get you extra help through the focused assistance program.
* for **group exams**, you may work with the other members in your group. You must understand and be able to explain everything you
submit. Teaching staff (coaches and TA's) will often provide assistance during your recitation if you forget something;
we will, for instance, tell you what the quadratic formula is if you forget.
* for **exams**, you may bring one page of handwritten notes, plus a calculator that doesn't do algebra for you. 
You may not use any other electronic devices (smartphones, smartwatches, earphones), may not look at other students' work, 
and may not consult or collaborate with anyone other than teaching staff during the exam.


<!--
For **the paper**, we expect you to do research and consult other people for their ideas, but you must write the paper yourself. (You should, of course, solicit feedback on your writing and ideas
from your peers and from people like the Writing Center!) We will provide more detail about the expectations for the paper when we assign it.
In your paper, you must show clearly which text is original to you, which reflects ideas which you found elsewhere but have digested and expressed in your own words, and which text is a direct quote from someone else’s words. You must cite any references that you use. (You do not need to cite anything from the course textbook, notes, or lectures.) If you consult a source for information, you should 
indicate the source of that information using an in-text citation or footnote. We don’t care what citation style you use.

Direct quotes must be indicated.
This is done by either blockquoting the other writer’s text or by putting it in quotation marks, with a citation immediately following. 
In general, however, you should use direct quotes only sparingly in your writing.

**A note on "paraphrasing":** Near-direct paraphrases, in which you take the organization and narrative of someone else's writing and merely replace words with synonyms, reorder words, omit sentences or phrases,
and the like, are never a good idea. The point of writing is to have original thoughts and communicate them clearly; if you are merely taking someone else's thoughts and repainting them, you are
not learning anything about either science or writing. The name for this sort of thing is _substitution plagiarism_; as the name implies, it's a type of plagiarism. We want you to tell your _own_
story.
-->

We reserve the right to seek a sanction of course failure for any instance of academic dishonesty.

### Students with disabilities and other access challenges

Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation.  If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course, please contact us to discuss accommodations we can make to ensure that the class is accessible to you, or collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process.

Students who have extended-time accommodations for exams are welcome to take their exams at CDR's facility. However, we can provide many accommodations
(extended time, most alternate formats, and a semi-private room) in the Physics Building. Please talk to Walter about this.

If you would like to discuss disability-related accommodations with CDR, please visit their website 
at <a href="http://disabilityservices.syr.edu">disabilityservices.syr.edu</a>, visit them in person in Room 309 of 8047 University Avenue, or call (315) 443-4498, TDD: (315) 443-1371 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting accommodations. CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible.

CDR is one of the most helpful offices on campus. They coordinate academic accommodations to students who have short-term illnesses (physical or mental). If you are injured or ill and need
academic accommodations beyond short-term due date extensions for PHY211, we will design those accommodations for you in collaboration with CDR.

If there are other things presenting access challenges to you in our class -- family situations, health challenges, etc. -- please 
talk to me as soon as possible. We will do whatever we must to ensure that you have every opportunity to gain skills in physics and be assessed on those skills fairly.

<a id="absences"></a>

---

### Absences, makeup work, and academic accommodations

We anticipate that students will occasionally miss class or submission deadlines for a variety of reasons.
We recognize that you have many things in your life that may supercede our class: 
events occurring on inflexible dates that are of singular
importance to your education, your family, stewardship of your health and the health of others, your career, your 
religious faith or life stance, or your participation in the democratic process or civic discourse. You might also 
miss class due to an unexpected emergency such as a car accident.

If you will have regular Friday absences (for instance, if you are an athlete-student), you should be in a Tuesday/Thursday recitation section; if you are not, contact <phyacademics@syr.edu> to transfer to one.
We will not excuse any absences for athletic travel on Fridays.

**If you miss an isolated lecture class**, you may be able to catch up during the recitation immediately following the class you miss. You are always welcome to come to 
my office hours for help (and should do so). 

**If you miss recitation**, send a note to your recitation TA and to Chandler Martin explaining your absence. You may come visit Chandler in the Physics 
Clinic the following Monday from 1-4 PM to work through the recitation exercise with him; he will give you credit for recitation attendance and participation, so long as you don't abuse this system.

**If you are late turning in a homework assignment**, you should describe the reason it is late to your TA and get their permission to turn it in late. 
(We will generally grant homework extensions for the reasons outlined above or in other situations where granting a homework extension will help you learn physics.) 
Everyone may turn in *one* homework assignment up to a week late without giving a reason
by writing on the top of it "This is my one late submission" and turning it in at the next
recitation. 
Otherwise, we won't accept late homework without a reason (and won't accept homework more than three days late without a compelling reason).

**If you miss a group quiz** for a good reason (detailed above), we will replace its grade with the grade you get on the corresponding exam held the next week.
To be eligible to do this, unless the situation is an emergency, you must contact your GTA and Walter and explain the reason for your absence and get it approved ahead of time, and then
contact your group and let them know that you will not be able to help them with their work. _(You may do this once.)_

**If you will miss an exam**, please send a note to Walter explaining the situation as far in advance
as possible. 

We may either:

* Use the "second chance portion" of the final exam to evaluate you on that topic, as a makeup
* Ask you to take a makeup exam during the last week of class, written or verbal
* Ask you to take a makeup exam during the next day or two, written or verbal
* Evaluate you on that material in some other way


**If you are falling significantly behind** -- if you have missed a week of recitation,
if you are seriously ill, if you have personal problems that prevent you from doing work for an extended period, etc. -- we will need to
make arrangements during office hours and design an accommodation specifically for your situation. To be eligible for this sort of thing,
you must come talk to us promptly once you fall behind so we can help you get back on track; do not tell me in May why you were unable
to do your homework in March. We will create a syllabus modification accommodation (including extended due dates or whatever else)
that is appropriate to your situation. 

We will do whatever we can to help you learn physics despite your challenges; however, your grade at the end of the term 
will be based only on how much physics you have learned.

We anticipate that students will occasionally need to miss class for events occurring on inflexible dates that are of singular 
importance to their education, their families, their health or the health of others, their careers, their
religious faith or life stance, or their participation in the democratic process. 
These absences will be excused (i.e. missing recitation or class for these reasons will not count against your 
participation grade).

These excused absences are generally: 

* Religious observances (declared in advance on MySlice during the first two weeks of class)

* Personal events of equal solemnity to major religious observances occurring on inflexible dates. This includes weddings and commitment ceremonies of close family members, funerals, and the like.

* Caregiving duties for sick family members

* For students off campus, severe disruptions to your living situation that prevent you from attending recitation

* Illness or injury that is sufficiently severe to prevent you from attending recitation 

* Attendance at academic events (for instance, travel to an academic conference, participation in a seminar, performance in the marching band or a student ensemble, etc.).

* Attendance at a professional development opportunity (a career fair, a job interview, a ROTC event) or work emergencies

* Participation in the political process (canvassing for a campaign, attendance at a scheduled demonstration or a spontaneous one in response to developing events)

If you must miss recitation for such a reason, please notify your recitation instructor in advance if possible. You may make up your missed recitation the following week. If you must miss an
*exam* for such a reason, please talk to one of the professors to make arrangements.



Absence from class for recreational activities unrelated to academics, professional development, or solemn family life will not be excused; these absences will count against your four dropped recitation participation grades. Unexcused absences include:

* Any Greek Life event (any activity put on by a Greek-letter organization, with the exception of purely academic honor societies that accept all students regardless of gender and do not maintain a house)

* Any athletic event (as an athlete or a spectator), whether NCAA-sanctioned or not. (If you must miss an *exam* for a NCAA-sponsored athletic event, come talk to us; we may be able to make arrangements for you to take it on the road.)

* Weather (unless you are a commuter student who cannot get to campus safely or campus is closed)
