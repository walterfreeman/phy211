title: Statement on the coronavirus outbreak
---

There have been a lot of rumors surrounding the novel coronavirus COVID-19 and how it will affect us here on campus. I'd like to briefly discuss how it might affect us here.

I am not an expert in infectious disease, and there is lots of information available from the Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization if you want to read details about how this virus spreads or how the outbreak works. The only thing I will say is that currently the risk to Syracuse University students and staff is quite low; currently, we are much more likely to become sick from seasonal flu than from COVID-19.

I would mostly like to talk about how we can respond -- as students, instructors, and members of this community -- in the context of this outbreak.

There are rumors that Syracuse is going to cancel classes. Classes will not be canceled, but if the outbreak comes to SU, we may move them to an online format. The administration hasn't made that decision yet, but instructors have been told that we should prepare to switch to online classes on short notice. If it comes to that, we are investigating ways to livestream lectures and still give you all an opportunity to ask questions and give feedback during them. Yesterday, we did a shakedown of a component of Blackboard that allows for collaborative teleconferences; we will be holding virtual recitations and extended office hours using that. We will continue to help you learn physics as we have before, and will figure out how to alter the format of exams to accommodate an online format. 

As always, you should avoid coming to class if you are sick -- with a cold, with the flu, or anything else. All of our slides are online, and we are happy to give extensions on homework to people who have been ill. If you're unable to come to recitation, you should work on the materials on your own, and contact your TA and professors for help over email. (Email with physics questions in it is my highest priority in my inbox; I am also happy to work via teleconference with people if needed.) If you want to take an exam despite being sick
with a minor but transmissible disease, like a cold, let me know and we'll get you a private room to take it in; if you are too sick to take it, you may take a makeup or drop it as your lowest exam grade.

However, even though there as yet no confirmed cases of COVID-19 here yet, something else has been spreading on campus: paranoia, fear, and bias, particularly against people from China. This is unfounded, harmful, and goes against the values of both this university and of physics itself. Our Chinese colleagues are no more likely to carry this virus than anyone else, and senseless fear of catching an illness from folks simply because of their country of origin is deeply harmful and accomplishes nothing. 

Some people, particularly students from China, have chosen to wear face masks during flu season. This has been common since I have been here at SU; it is not a new practice. It does not mean that the person wearing the mask is sick, and does not mean that anyone has anything to fear from them. Again, bias against people simply because of their cultural hygiene practices is harmful to our whole community and does nothing to avoid sickness.

This sort of fear of the unknown is anathema to the values of science itself. The clearer picture of our world that the scientific method gives allows us to distinguish the few things that are scary from the many things that are not -- such as people from different places who live or speak differently. In my career as a physicist, I've had the pleasure of working alongside brilliant and kind folks from every inhabited continent and dozens of countries. Collaboration between scientists from different backgrounds has continually been a source of insight and vigor in this enterprise to understand our world a little better, and getting to know colleagues from around the world has been one of the great joys of my career and life. Unfounded exclusion of and bias against some of our colleagues, for any reason,
hurts us all -- both as human beings seeking a happy life and as scientists and engineers who hope to make progress shaping our world for the common good.

**To the international students**, particularly those coming from countries hard-hit by this outbreak: know that you are welcome here, and this campus belongs to you as much as it belongs to anyone else. I am humbled by the fact that you've come so far to this little physics class in our snowy, beautiful corner of America. It is the greatest compliment anyone could give me that folks are willing to travel across the ocean to come study physics with me, and I hope to repay that compliment by giving you the warmest welcome to our class, to our university, and to our country that I can.

**To everyone:** if there is anything I can help you with, whether it involves physics or something beyond, please let me know, and I'll try to make it happen.
