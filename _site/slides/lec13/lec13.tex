Physics is not a spectator sport. 
\BS

You don't learn physics from watching me do stuff; you learn by doing stuff yourselves.

\BS

So, we're going to do an exercise in class where you discover the fundamental idea of energy methods, called the {\bf work-energy theorem}, yourselves.

\BS

Work on the handout exercise with the people near you; raise your hands and we'll come by and answer questions.

\BS

Periodically we'll pause and make sure we're all on the same page. 

\BS

We'll weave some examples in here, too.

  We've encountered something before that eliminates time as a variable...

\bigskip

The ``third kinematics relation''
\begin{equation*}
  v_f^2 - v_0^2 = 2a\Delta x
\end{equation*}

\pause
\bigskip

Multiply by $\frac{1}{2}m$:

\begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{2} mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2} mv_0^2 = am\, \Delta x
\end{equation*}

That thing on the right looks familiar...

What if the force isn't constant? 

\BS

Simple -- we just pretend that it is constant for little bits of time, and add them up to find the work:

$$
W = \int F dx
$$

\pause

\BS

Note that the sign of the work {\it does not depend on the choice of coordinate system}:\\ if I reverse 
my coordinates, both $F$ and $dx$ pick up a minus sign.

\BI
\item A force in the same direction as something's motion makes it speed up, and does positive work
\item A force in the opposite direction as something's motion makes it slow down, and does negative work
