### Study Session Schedule

All held in Physics Building B129E unless we announce otherwise.

* Tuesday, May 2: 10am-2pm -- room 208
* Wednesday, May 3: 2pm-5pm
* Thursday, May 4: 10am-2pm
* Friday, May 5: 1pm-3pm

### Final Exam Study Advice

Here is a <a href="unit-4-review.pdf">theoretical guide to Unit 4's material on rotation</a>, in 
case someone finds it useful.

The most important things to make sure you understand for the first half of the final exam (new material) are:

* **Static equilibrium**, in which an object does not move, and you need to figure out what must
be true for it to neither translate nor rotate:
  * HW9 #4 and #5 
  * Recitation week 12 day 2 #2 ("orange seller problem") Note the "torque chart" technique to keep organized.
* **Rotational kinetic energy**:
  * HW9 #6 
  * HW8 "spool problem"
  * Recitation week 12 day 1 #2 and #3
* **Coupled rotational and translational dynamics**:
  * Recitation week 13 day 1 #2 ("bucket and pulley") 
  * Week 13 day 2 #1 
  * Week 13 day 2 #2 ("ping-pong ball").
  * HW9 #9 ("wheel problem")

The last recitation of the semester on acoustics contains everything you need to know about that.

### Second Chance Materials

Here are the "exam second chance" exercises, along with copies of past exams and practice exams
that they reference.

These are optional. If you choose to do them, then you may do up to three for an extra homework grade.
(That grade will only increase your overall grade; it cannot decrease it.)

We suggest that you do the three corresponding to your lowest three exam questions, since those 
are the topics that you will see again on the day of the final. You can see what your lowest three
exam questions are by looking at the exams you have gotten back or on Blackboard.

**Note:** These exercises are due on the day of the final, not the last recitation (as stated here).
