#### [How do I turn in my homework?](#hwturnin)
Give it to your recitation TA at the beginning of recitation. Make sure that:

* you have put your name on your work 
* you have stapled it
* you have done each problem on a separate side of paper (so two problems are on each sheet of paper, one front and one back)


<a id="clinic"></a>

#### [What and where is the Physics Clinic?](#clinic)

The Physics Clinic is room 112. It's where we hold our help sessions, but at other times you can find a tutor there as well.

You will likely find people working on the same homework as you if you go there, and you can work together!

<a id="contact"></a>
#### [Who's teaching this class, what do they all do, and how do I contact them?](#contact)

The **professors** are Matt Rudolph (<msrudolp@syr.edu>, room 325) and Walter Freeman (<wafreema@syr.edu>, room 215). We are in charge of giving the lectures, writing materials, 
helping students learn physics or in any other way we can, helping grade exams, and 
leading the course as a whole. You can email us, find us before or after class, or come to help hours 
in the Physics Clinic. We also might be in our offices.

Contact the professors if:

* You have a question about physics
* You have a suggestion that will improve the course as a whole or the lecture portion specifically
* Something is badly wrong in recitation that your recitation TA can't fix
* You will miss an exam
* You need high-level assistance with anything

The **recitation teaching assistants** are PhD students in physics who work as junior instructors as part of their training. They are in charge of leading recitations, grading homework, and grading exams.
They also hold help hours in the Physics Clinic.

* Merrill Asp, head TA, <masp01@syr.edu>
* Vidyesh Rao Anisetti, <vvaniset@syr.edu>
* Soumik Banerjee, <sbaner03@syr.edu>
* Prashali Chauhan, <prchauha@syr.edu>
* Kevin Ching, <keching@syr.edu>
* Mingwei Dai, <mdai07@syr.edu>
* Kesavan Manivannan, <kmanivan@syr.edu>
* Mario Olivares, <maolivar@syr.edu>
* Zhiwen Sun, <zsun31@syr.edu>

Contact the recitation TA's if:

* You have a question about physics
* You have a suggestion that will improve their recitation, or that you want them to pass on to us
* Something is wrong with your homework or exam grade
* You will miss a recitation

The **undergraduate coaches** are undergraduate students like yourself who took this class in the past. They are in charge of helping you learn physics in your recitations.

Talk to the undergraduate coaches if:

* You have a question about physics
* You want advice on studying (they were in your shoes pretty recently and can give the best advice of any of us!)

<a id="book"></a>
#### [How do I get the textbook, and do I need it?](#book)

The book is *University Physics Volume 1* (W. Moebs, S. Ling, J. Sanny, et al.), published by OpenStax. This is an open-access textbook available to anyone under the terms of the CC-BY 4.0 license and can be <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-1">downloaded for free</a>. 

You'll need the book; we want you to read it ahead of class to ensure you're familiar with the concepts beforehand, and we'll ask you some short questions on Blackboard before lecture. We will skip around
in the book in order to present things in an order that makes things easier to learn.

---
<a id="math"></a>
#### [What math skills will I need?](#math)

You'll need to know how to:

* relate graphs to the functions they represent
* use the quadratic formula
* deduce missing angles/sides from right triangles using trigonometry
* solve a system of equations using substitution

That's it.

---
<a id="firstphysics"></a>

#### [This is my first physics class! Will I do okay?](#firstphysics)

This class is designed for people who've never had a physics class before, so you're in the right place. While many of your classmates have had high school physics, 
many students who do well in PHY211 have never taken physics before. Statistics from last year show that while students who took non-AP physics in high school *did* do
better on Exam 1, their advantage disappeared as the semester went on.

If this is your first physics class, make sure you ask us for help if you don't understand things, especially in the first unit. (This is good advice for everyone, of course.)

---
<a id="objectives"></a>
#### [What will be learning?](#objectives)

After each unit, the skills you should gain are:

* Unit 1 (Kinematics):
  * Translate between verbal, graphical, algebraic, and numerical descriptions of an object's motion
  * Given a description of an object's acceleration, create a description of how its position and velocity change, or vice versa
  * Use vectors to describe motion in two and three dimensions, and use trigonometry to manipulate them
  * Incorporate physical units (meters, seconds, and so on) into algebraic and arithmetic statements

* Unit 2 (Forces):  
  * Identify the forces that act on the objects present in a variety of physical situations
  * Describe the basic properties of the forces of tension, friction, gravity, and normal forces
  * Using Newton's second law, construct mathematical relations between those forces and the objects' motion
  * Identify constraints on those forces and on objects' motion based on Newton's third law and the geometry of the situations at hand
  * Describe the forces required to cause an object to move in uniform circular motion
  * Use the previous skills to predict how an object will move in any given situation, and the forces involved in its motion

* Unit 3 (Conservation laws)  
  * Use conservation of momentum to solve problems that involve collisions and explosions
  * Use the work-energy theorem and conservation of energy to determine properties of the motion of systems to which they apply, and recognize which systems those are

* Unit 4 (Rotation)
  * Construct analogies between the properties of rotational motion and the properties of translational motion
  * Use conservation of energy to solve problems in which objects rotate as well as translate
  * Describe the relationship between the forces that act on an object and the torque they apply about any given axis
  * Describe the relationship between the torque applied to an object and its angular acceleration
  * Use both $\vec F=m\vec a$ and $\tau = I \alpha$ in tandem to predict the motion of objects that both translate and rotate

* Throughout (Process of Science)
  * Describe the basics of scientific integrity and the properties of both honest scientific arguments and dishonest pseudoscientific claims
  * Critique (pseudo)scientific claims that are made in bad faith, and describe the problems with them
  * Critically examine sound and unsound scientific claims that seek to overturn preexisting consensus. In particular:
    * Describe the primacy of empirical measurements in evaluating scientific claims
    * Critique flawed arguments that fail to address empirical data 
    * Critique flawed arguments that fail to address the broader framework of physical laws of nature
    * Critique flawed arguments that focus on the identities of the people involved, rather than their data and logic

<a id="grades"></a>
#### [How will grades be calculated?](#grades)

The various parts of the course count as follows:

| Item                         |            Date           | Points           |
|------------------------------|:-------------------------:|-----------------:|
| Homework                     | Due throughout            |              25  |
| Exam 1                       |    4 February             |              15  |
| Exam 2                       |    3 March                |              15  |
| Exam 3                       |    7 April                |              15  |
| Final Exam                   |    4 May, 3PM-5PM         |              30  |
| Recitation participation |   Throughout the semester | 10               |
| Group practice exams         | The Friday prior to each exam                          | 15               |
| Paper on the nature of science | 27 April                | 15               |
| Pre-lecture quizzes          | Throughout the semester   | 5                |

Note that the grades you see on Blackboard are different from this number of points. For instance, each exam will be scored out of 100, but will count as 15 points for your final grade.

The lowest of your exam grades, the lowest homework set grade, and your four lowest recitation participation grades will be dropped. If your final exam grade is lower 
than any of your three midterm exam grades, then the final exam will instead only count for 15 points. 
Note however that students with an unusually low recitation participation grade for any given unit will not be eligible to drop the
corresponding exam without prior permission, at our discretion. 

This will result in a total of 130 possible points. This value will then be converted to a percentage (by dividing by 1.3), and grades will be assigned as follows:

- A : >88
- A-: 80-88
- B+: 75-80
- B : 70-75
- B-: 65-70
- C+: 62-64
- C : 58-62
- C-: 55-58
- D : 50-55
- F : less than 50


---
<a id="hwgrades"></a>
#### [How will homework be graded?](#hwgrades)

We'll choose two problems out of each homework set. These will be graded fully, out of ten points, for correctness. 

Note that you must *explain your reasoning* in solving the homework problems. Solutions consisting only of algebra that isn't self-explanatory may not get full credit even if they are correct.

Solutions consisting of a bunch of numbers, substituted into the algebra before you're ready to extract physical meaning from them, *certainly* won't get full credit.

The other problems will be graded simply for completeness, quickly getting a grade of 0 (not attempted seriously), 1 (partial answer), 2 (complete answer whether correct or not).

---
<a id="recgrades"></a>
#### [How will recitation participation be graded?](#recgrades)

Each day your TA will give you a grade from 0 to 3, with 3 meaning "working with your group" down to 0 meaning "either not there or not working". 

Your lowest four unexcused recitation grades will be dropped, plus any excused absences you have discussed with us.

---
<a id="prelecture"></a>
#### [How do pre-lecture questions work?](#prelecture)

These will be posted on Blackboard a few days before lecture. (Matt Rudolph is in charge of these. Walter Freeman is allergic to Blackboard.) We'll curve the grades so that 
anyone making a serious attempt to answer them correctly will get 100%.

---
<a id="lab"></a>
#### [Do we have lab this week?, and other lab questions](#lab) 

The lab is a different class. Ask your lab TA (different from your recitation TA) or Sam Sampere about it. You can of course ask any of us about the *physics* of what you do in lab.

---
<a id="paper"></a>
#### [What about this paper?](#paper)

We'll also be talking about the nature of science in our class: 

* What is science? What is its history?
* How does it differ from other ways of knowing about our world?
* How do things try to imitate science in order to try to deceive others?
* How does the process of science sometimes go wrong?

We'll assign a paper about this. You can read last year's assignment <a href="paper.html">here</a>. (This will change slightly but not that much as we're getting ready to assign it.) You'll 
have a couple of weeks to write it. If it's good, you'll get a high grade. If it's *great*, you may get over 100%. If it's plagiarized, you'll fail the class and get in worse trouble than that. 
(Don't do this.)

<a id="exams"></a>
#### [When are our exams?](#exams)

|------------------------------|:-------------------------:|
| Group Exam 1                 |    31 January             |
| Exam 1                       |    4 February             |
| Group Exam 2                 |    28 February            |
| Exam 2                       |    3 March                |
| Group Exam 3                 |    3 April                |
| Exam 3                       |    7 April                |
| Final Exam                   |    4 May, 3PM-5PM         |

---
<a id="calculator"></a>
#### [Do I need a calculator for the exams? What kind?](#calculator)

You may use a calculator that can do basic arithmetic and trigonometry, but not one that can solve equations symbolically or that you can program. These are called "scientific calculators" (kind of 
a misnomer, since scientists these days tend to use computers!), and you can get them very cheaply from Amazon. If you don't have one, you can just leave all your answers in symbolic form on the 
exams.

---
<a id="ods"></a>
#### [I take my exams at ODS. What do I need to do?](#ods)

Register with ODS to take your exam there. We'll send a PDF over. (You don't need to notify us. We do this all the time.)

Most students with disabilities should still be able to take your *group exams* in recitation, since most disabilities can be accommodated by the presence of other group members. If 
this for some reason doesn't work for you, please let us and ODS know.

If you need an alternate format exam (large print, etc.), please let us know in advance.

---
<a id="latehomework"</a>
#### [I'll be late turning in my homework. What do I need to do?](#latehomework)

Tell your recitation TA why you need an extension and when you'll have it done by. If they are okay with this,
then they'll make arrangements with you to turn it in late.

---
<a id="absenceclass"></a>
#### [I need to miss a lecture. What do I need to do?](#absenceclass)

Contact your friends and figure out what you missed. You don't need to tell us.

---
<a id="absencerec"></a>
#### [I need to miss recitation. What do I need to do?](#absencerec)

If you are going to be absent for an *excused reason*:

* Religious observances (declared in advance on MySlice during the first two weeks of class)
* Personal events of equal solemnity to major religious observances occurring on inflexible dates. This includes weddings and commitment ceremonies of close family members, funerals, and the like.
* Caregiving duties for sick family members, other family emergencies, or singularly-important events
* Illness or injury that jeopardizes your health or the health of others if you come to class
* Attendance at academic events (for instance, travel to an academic conference, participation in a seminar, performance in the marching band or a student ensemble, etc.).
* Attendance at a professional development opportunity (a career fair, a job interview, a ROTC event)
* Participation in the political process (canvassing for a campaign, attendance at a scheduled demonstration or a spontaneous one in response to current events)

... let your TA know in advance if possible, and give them documentation. Make arrangements to make up the practice you'll miss (we post all the recitation material).

<br><br>
If you are going to be absent for an *unexcused reason*:

* An athletic competition (as an athlete or a spectator)
* A Greek Life event (other than a purely academic organization's academic event)
* Anything else related to recreation 
* Weather (unless campus is closed or the weather would pose a special danger to you because of health or commute). 

... let your TA know out of courtesy, and remember we drop your four lowest participation grades.

---
<a id="absencegroup"></a>
#### [I need to miss a group exam. What do I need to do?](#absencegroup)

If your absence is for an excused reason (see above), let your TA know. We'll give you the same grade you get on the main exam for your group exam, as well.

If your absence is for a recreational reason (including athletics), we will make the same allowance for you, but only once.

---
<a id="absenceexam"></a>
#### [I need to miss an exam. What do I need to do?](#absenceexam)

If your absence is for an excused reason, let the professors know as much in advance as possible. We'll make arrangements with you.

Note that students with minor illnesses (a cold) should still come to exams. 

---
<a id="gradeappeal"></a>
#### [I think there's something wrong with my homework or exam grade. What do I do?](#gradeappeal)

Talk to your TA sometime *other* than when they're teaching recitation; their clinic hours are a great place to do this.

If there is something wrong with the arithmetic of your grade (we added numbers wrong, or we mistyped something in Blackboard), we'll fix it right there with no fuss. (Sorry!)

If you think that the grade you got doesn't correctly reflect the physics knowledge you demonstrated in the problem, explain why to your TA. Note the following:

* Before hearing your grade appeal, the TA may ask you to solve the problem on your own on the board, without notes. If you're going to appeal your grade for something, the least you can do 
is to go back and figure out the solution!
* Your grade will still be based on what you originally wrote down on your homework/exam
* We'll regrade the whole problem from scratch; it *is* possible for your grade to go *down* if it turns out the original grader made a mistake and gave you a grade that's too high.
