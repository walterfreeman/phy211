**Announcements**

Welcome to Physics 211! This is the main course website; I will post announcements, homework, preparation 
materials, and the like here. Lecture notes will be linked from the calendar.

Before Thursday's class, you should:

* Go to recitation, meet your groupmates, and learn your TA's name and email address
* Read the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, particularly the section on the course philosophy
* Get a copy of the <a href="syllabus.html#books">textbook</a> from either an online merchant or the bookstore
* Get a paper clicker and bring it to class on Thursday and every other day 

The first homework assignment is <a href="hw/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a>, due next Wednesday.

**Weekend travel announcement**

Recitation attendance counts toward your grade, with exceptions allowed for normal
reasons, including religious observances. Per the policy in the syllabus, personal events
of equal gravity to religious observances that occur on inflexible dates are given the 
same deference. **Anyone traveling to Washington DC this upcoming weekend to participate
in political activity or speech, whether in assent or dissent, is excused from recitation on Friday.**

* You are still responsible for the material. If you plan to be gone, please let your TA
and groupmates know on Wednesday. Get your groupmates' emails and correspond with them.

* You need to document that you were in Washington by providing documentation to your TA.
This can be a bus/train ticket, memorabilia from an event you attended, or a cellphone picture including your face and one of the following:
	* a WMATA (subway) system map or Washington DC street sign
	* an iconic Washington landmark (Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, etc.)
	* whatever political activity you are participating in (a crowd carrying signs, etc.)
