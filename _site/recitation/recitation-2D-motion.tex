\centerline{\Large Question 1: a prankster}     

A mischievous SUOC student has climbed on the roof of a snow-covered building and is trying to hit her friend with snowballs as he walks through the Quad. She throws them at an angle of $20^\circ$ above the horizontal at a speed of $v_0=5$ m/s. 
The building has a height $h=6$ m.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Draw a cartoon of the problem, making clear your coordinate system and origin, and
labelling interesting things.

\vspace{4in}

\item Write expressions for $x(t)$, $y(t)$, $v_x(t)$, and $v_y(t)$, substituting in variables that you know.


\newpage
\item Write sentences in terms of your algebraic variables that allow you to answer the following. You  
will need to incorporate vector language at times: for instance, you may need to use terms like ``the magnitude of the
velocity vector'' (which will require you to solve for both $v_x$ and $v_y$.)

\BI
\item How much time does it take for the snowballs to hit the Quad?

\vspace{1.5in}

\item Where do the snowballs land on the Quad?

\vspace{1.5in}
\item How fast are the snowballs traveling when they hit the Quad?

\vspace{1.5in}
\item In what direction are they moving when they land on the Quad?

\centerline{\Large Question 2: retaliation!}     

He decides to throw a snowball back at her. He's standing a distance $d$ from the side of the building, and 
throws a snowball at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal at a speed $v_0$. However, the snowball slips out of his hand when he throws it,
and it doesn't go very fast -- instead of hitting her on top of the building, it hits the side of the building.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Draw a cartoon of the problem, making clear your coordinate system and origin, and
labelling interesting things.

\vspace{3in}

\item Write expressions for $x(t)$, $y(t)$, $v_x(t)$, and $v_y(t)$, substituting in variables that you know.

\vspace{1.5in}

\item Write a sentence in terms of your algebraic variables that will let you figure out how far above the ground 
the snowball hits the side of the building.

\newpage

\item Based on your sentence, figure out how far above the ground the snowball hits the building. Your answer should be 
in terms of $v_0$, $\theta$, $d$, and $g$.

\vspace{3in}

\item He doesn't give up, though, and throws another snowball at her -- again at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal.
He throws this one harder, and it hits her feet as she stands on the edge of the building. Write a sentence in terms of your algebraic variables that will let you figure out how fast he had to throw it. 

\vspace{1.5in}

\item Now, based on your previous sentence, figure out the initial speed of the second snowball he threw.

\end{enumerate}
