### Physics Clinic schedule

As you know, the work for our class isn't designed to be done by yourself; it's designed to be done alongside a guide. We have lots of opportunities for you to meet with the professor, the coaches, and the GTA's for our class in the Physics Clinic.

The Physics Clinic is a Zoom room where students may go to get help learning anything they may need. Connect at <a href="https://syracuseuniversity.zoom.us/j/93889871629">https://syracuseuniversity.zoom.us/j/93889871629</a>.

I will be holding my office hours there, as will our staff.

**If you have missed recitation**, come to the Physics Clinic when a Physics 211 TA is there to make it up before the end of the day on the following Tuesday. If there are particular people you would like to work with:
