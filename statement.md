## Statement on the 2016 election
<div align="justify">
<p>
A few words, first, to all of you who are international students. It doesn't matter what country is on your passport; this is your class and this is your campus, as much as they are anyone's. I am honored and I am humbled that so many of you have traveled so far to come study in my little old astronomy class here at Syracuse University. It's the greatest compliment that anyone could give me and our university. This university is yours, too, and you are honored guests in this country.

At a time when the world was concerned about nuclear annihilation and seemed divided in two, we sent a little robot into space. So many of our brightest minds spent their genius on producing plutonium to make nuclear weapons, but this little craft used the energy stored in plutonium instead to generate warmth, keeping its instruments and radios running in the cold of space. And some of the more hopeful among us -- scientists who spent as much time imagining as they spent calculating -- argued that, before Voyager's power dwindled to the point where it no longer could, we should take one last picture of Earth. Here it is -- all of us, made of the same atoms as each other and as the stars, all on this little blue pixel right here. This is but one in a long line of moments when we've looked to the stars and told stories about them that bring us together and that inspire a shared sense of community. 

<p>

But throughout our history on this little world people have drummed up fear of The Other for selfish reasons, and at the moment fear of people who look different, who believe in different gods, who love differently, who speak different languages, or who call different places home is being used to drum up hatred and exclusion. Really? You're going to deny someone their fundamental dignity because their ancestors came from a different spot on that pixel, or because they have a bit more melanin in their skin? 

<p>

I'm just a scientist. I've chosen to devote my career to teaching people what's in the sky and how it works, and hoping that the things of astronomy and physics, in their elegance and beauty, will inspire some of you as they've inspired me. 

<p>

But, at the moment, my career is seeming awfully impotent in the face of what we need. At the beginning of this class I told you that this class belonged to all of you, and especially to the non-science majors. Now you're the ones whose skills seem so much more valuable than my own. If one of you political science majors is able to argue a little more compellingly that climate change is not a hoax but a very real problem that warrants urgent attention, then I'm a happy professor. If any of you journalism majors have taken just a bit of the scientific philosophy of skepticism and pluralism to heart, and doggedly pursue an investigative story with integrity rather than accepting the dictates of the powerful, then I couldn't care less whether you remember Kepler's laws. 

<p>

And if one of you television/radio/film or creative writing majors -- the storytellers and the dreamers among the class -- is inspired by anything in this class to tell a tale about the pursuit of a better life beyond the confines of Earth, then you've made my work worth it. Your questions about other worlds that might be are, if anything, more crucial now than folks like myself who study mostly only this world that we have. 

<p>

In this era of animosity I can't do much. But I can do something -- I'm a professor, if a very junior one, at this university. And I want you all to know that no matter what grades you make, no matter who you voted for, and no matter what you look like -- no matter what god or gods you do or don't believe in, how you dress, what language you speak, what country you're from, how many of Kepler's laws you remember, what gender you are and how you express it, or the person or people you love -- you are welcome in my class. You're welcome at our university. You're equal in dignity to each and every other person in this room. You're free to express your ideas, here and elsewhere, in any peaceful way that affords others this same liberty. And if 
<b>anybody</b> on this campus tries to deny you this welcome, this dignity, or these rights, let me know. Let my colleagues know. You have allies from this temporary professor all the way up to the chancellor's mansion. And we will exhaust our resources down to the last dregs to set things right.
