\end{center}
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Mechanics}}

\large The most fundamental question physics asks:

\bigskip

\Large \centerline{\color{Red}``Why do things move in the ways that they do?''}


\bigskip

\large

The answer is given by Isaac Newton's second law of motion:


\bigskip

\begin{center}
\Large {\color{Blue} ``Objects accelerate when pushed by forces; they accelerate in the direction of the force, proportional to the size of the force divided by their mass.''}
\end{center}
\normalsize


\bigskip
\large
That's it. We will spend much of our class talking about the meaning and consequences of this one statement.

\BS\pause

Let's see an example...


}


\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The physicist's eye}}

\large

Physics is about {\color{Blue} understanding complicated things in terms of simple pieces}, like Newton's law.

\pause
\bigskip

The perspective of physics is one that looks at a situation and asks:

\begin{itemize}
\item{``What phenomena are involved in this thing?''}
\item{``How do they interact to determine its behavior?''}
\end{itemize}
\pause
\bigskip

In this class, you'll learn about some of those simple pieces, but that's not the important thing.

\bigskip

You'll also learn the skill of asking those two questions, and develop {\color{Blue}a physicist's perspective for solving problems}.

\bigskip

This will serve you well in whatever field you pursue, since the ability to quickly look at a problem and understand the crucial 
elements is universally helpful.

\bigskip

\pause

\color{Red}It turns out that people with physics training find good jobs all over industry, even in non-STEM fields, because of this skill!

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Metaphors: sports and music}}
\large

Learning physics is like learning to play a musical instrument.

\bigskip

The hard part isn't learning the notes -- it's being able to play them, and tell a story with them.

\bigskip

How does studying the piano work?

\begin{itemize}
\item{Your teacher shows you a few techniques, and gives you a piece to learn to play}
\item{You take it home, practice it, and get stuck on difficult parts}
\item{You ask your teacher for advice; they guide you}
\item{You practice some more}
\item{You repeat the previous steps until you've mastered the technique and the music}
\item Over time, you become fluent in music as a new language
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Physics is like this. We don't expect you to master everything immediately; physics takes practice, and it's
okay to get stuck and ask questions. In fact, it's what we expect!
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The Physics Clinic}}
\large
The Clinic is in room 112; it's a large room with tables, boards, 
and (usually) a graduate teaching assistant. Often the professors and coaches are there, too.

\bigskip

You can go there whenever the building is open to work in groups on your homework, and
ask each other and the GTA for help.

\bigskip

I also hold help hours there. They'll fluctuate based on when homework is due. 

\BS

{\color{Red}This week I'll be in the Physics Clinic Tuesday 2-4pm and Friday 12-2pm.}

\bigskip

This is an excellent resource for you to use; why do your homework alone when you can work
with your peers and instructors? 
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The course Discord server}}

Last year the course Discord server was home to a nearly 24-hour 
conversation, with students getting help from me, the GTA's and coaches, and each other.

\BS

It also became a social space, and many of our students found that
their classmates are nifty folks.

\bigskip

I might not be there, and I might have other urgent stuff to do, but helping students learn is a very high priority, so 
if I'm around, likely I can drop whatever I'm doing and help you with physics.

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Dimensions}}
\large
Things in nature aren't just described by numbers; they have an associated {\it dimension},
and we measure them using a {\it system of units}.

\BS

We have three different kinds of dimension:

\Large

\BI
\item {\bf Length}: usually measured in {\bf meters}; also inches, miles, light-years...
\item {\bf Mass}: usually measured in {\bf kilograms}; also grams, tonnes...
\item {\bf Time}: usually measured in {\bf seconds}; also hours, days...
\EI

\pause

\BS

For the Americans: the pound measures {\it force}, not mass. The word 
``weight'' means ``force due to gravity''; an object with a mass of
one kilogram weighs 2.2 pounds on Earth.

Here the dimensions match on both sides; this is a valid statement.
\EC
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Math, physics-style, II: working with units}}

\large
Units of measure (km, hours) follow the rules of algebra.

\Large
\begin{align*}
s &= (2 \,{\rm \color{Red}hr}) \times \frac{100\, \rm km}{1\, \rm \color{Red} hr}\\
s &= 200 \rm\, km
\end{align*}

\BS

Velocity is thus a length divided by a time: km/hr, m/s, etc. What about acceleration?

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Math, physics-style, II: working with units}}
\BC
\large
``A falling object's speed increases by 10 meters per second every second.''

\BS

$$
10 \frac{\frac{\rm meter}{\rm second}}{\rm second}
$$

This is really awkward to write...

\BS

$$
10 \frac{\frac{\rm meter}{\rm second}}{\rm second} = 10 \rm m/\rm s^2
$$

Much better! Even though nobody's ever seen a ``squared second'', this still makes
sense mathematically. We can build all kinds of compound units this way.
\EC
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Math, physics-style, III: compound units}}

\Large Newton's second law says that force is equal to mass times acceleration. In 
symbols, $F=ma$. What units could you measure force in?

\Huge

\color{C}C: $\rm m/s^2$\\

Complete description of motion: ``Where is my object at each point in time?''

This corresponds to a mathematical function. Two ways to represent these. Suppose I drop
a ball off a building, putting the origin at the ground and calling ``up'' the positive direction:

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Velocity: how fast position changes}}
\large
The slope of the position vs. time curve has a special significance. Here's one with a constant slope:

\medskip

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{constant-v-crop.pdf}}

\bigskip

\pause

Slope is $\frac{{\rm rise}}{{\rm run}}$ = $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$ = $\frac{2\,\rm m}{1 \, \rm s}$ = 2 meters per second (positive;
it could well be negative!)

\bigskip \pause

{\color{Red} $\rightarrow$ The slope here -- change in position over change in time -- is the {\bf velocity}!} Note that it can be
positive or negative, depending on which way the object moves.

}


\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Constant-velocity motion: connecting graphs to algebra}}
\large
If an object moves with constant velocity, its position vs. time graph is a line:

\medskip

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{constant-v-2-crop.pdf}}

We know the equation of a straight line is is $x = mt + b$ (using $t$ and $x$ as our axes).

\BI
\item{$m$ is the slope, which we identified as the velocity}
\item{$b$ is the vertical intercept, which we recognize as the value of $x$ when $t=0$}
\EI

We can thus change the variable names to be more descriptive:

\bigskip

\centerline{\Large{{\color{Red} $x(t) = vt + x_0$} (constant-velocity motion)}}

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Going from ``equations of motion'' to answers}}

\large

{\color{Red}$x(t) = vt + x_0$} is called an {\it equation of motion}; in this case, it is valid for constant-velocity motion.

\medskip

It gives you the same information as a position vs. time graph, but in algebraic form.

\bigskip
\bigskip

\normalsize

To solve real problems, we need to be able to translate physical questions into algebraic statements:
\bigskip
\bigskip

\BI
\item{``If a car starts at milepost 30 and drives at 50 mph, where is it an hour later?''}
\pause
\BI
\item{Using $x(t) = x_0 + vt$, with $x_0=30\, {\rm mi}$ and $v = 50 \frac{\rm mi}{\rm hr}$, calculate $x$ at $t=1\, {\rm hr}$}

\large

A general framework for solving constant-velocity problems algebraically:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Decide on a coordinate system: where is $x=0$, and which way is positive?}
\item{Write down the equation of motion $x(t)=x_0+vt$ for each object}
\item{Ask ``How can I translate the thing I'm looking for into an algebraic statement?''}
\item{Do the algebra!}
\end{enumerate}
