    <h4 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h4>

<p>The accelerations of the two objects are not necessarily the same.
The most rigorous way to think about this is to use different $a$ variables
for all relevant accelerations ($x$ and $y$ for the block on the table, and $y$ for the hanging mass). Then you’ll need to think about how they relate.
(Yes, the block on the table and the hanging block have the same <em>magnitude</em> of their accelerations, but how the <em>directions</em> relate will depend on your choice of coordinate systems.)</p>

<p>When taking the limit, the easiest thing to do is to recognize that (big thing + small thing) is very nearly the same as just (small thing). In symbols: the limit of $1/(x+y)$ as $x$ becomes much bigger than $y$ is $1/y$. Note also that the limit of $x/(x+y)$ as $y$ becomes small is 1.</p>

<h4 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h4>

<p>Note that one block goes up and one block goes down; note also that you may, but do not have to, use the same coordinate system for both blocks.</p>

<p>To check your answer for (a), make sure that it gives you sensible results for the case when both masses are equal. If you get something nonsensical, then make sure your signs above are correct.</p>

<h4 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h4>

<p>There are two tricky elements here that make it different than problem (1):</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many times does the string connect to the block on the table?</li>
  <li>What is the relation between the two accelerations? (Their magnitudes are <em>not</em> equal now.)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h4>

<p>Here you will have to think clearly about the direction static friction points. In this case it depends on the value of $m_3$.
Since static friction can point in two different directions, one way to handle it is to simply draw two separate force diagrams and 
analyze the system twice.</p>

<h4 id="problem-5">Problem 5</h4>

<p>This is a straightforward problem in which the hardest step is constructing the force diagrams, and ensuring that you have every
force pointing in the correct direction. You will get a system of four equations with four unknowns once you apply the constraints
that the blocks don’t fall through the incline and that the rope doesn’t stretch.</p>

<h4 id="problem-6">Problem 6</h4>

<p>Note that $a=0$ here: she only wants to keep moving the sled, not to accelerate it. (I imagine a hiker dragging something over 
a long distance: she just wants to keep on walking.) Again, think clearly about your force diagrams: which way does traction
point on the hiker? (Which way is she trying to walk?) Don’t make assumptions
about what the normal forces on the sled and the hiker are (hint: they’re not equal to their weights).</p>

<h4 id="problem-7">Problem 7</h4>

<p>In all cases here $a=0$ (since all I want to do is to drive at a constant velocity, and not suffer an uncontrolled acceleration down
the hill).</p>

<p>You may either draw two separate normal forces on your diagram, or simply add a factor of 2/3 to the forward traction force.</p>

<p>Think clearly about which way traction points when I’m trying to climb a hill, and when I’m trying to slow my descent when I’m going down one.</p>

<p>For the last part, consider what things help drivers avoid crashes: the ability to steer and the ability to brake. (I am not often in a situation where the way to avoid hitting an object in the road is “go faster”!)</p>
