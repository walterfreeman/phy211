\sc Second Chance Exercise - ``Soccer Problem'' (2D Kinematics / Projectile Motion)\rm

\pagenumbering{gobble}




\normalsize
This second chance exercise is for people who want to review 2D constant-acceleration kinematics including the quadratic formula.

If one of your lowest three exam problem grades was on the ``soccer problem'', you may complete it and turn it in to earn an extra homework grade, which we will help you earn 100\% on. This will help your end-of-term average.

If you do this, it is due on the last day of recitation.

This exam problem covered 2D motion. In it, you needed to determine the initial position a soccer ball was kicked from given knowledge of its path.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compare this problem to the ``hiker and boot'' problem from Week 3, Recitation 1 at \url{https://walterfreeman.github.io/phy211/recitation/week3/recitation-2D-motion.pdf}. How is it similar to that problem, and how is it different?
	
	\item Find a problem on Homework 2 that is similar to this one. How is the same, and how is it different?
	
	\item Compare the way you used the quadratic formula in this problem to the ``roadrunner problem'' from Homework 1. How did you determine which root to use in that problem, and how did you determine it here?
	
	\item The first practice exam is here: \url{https://walterfreeman.github.io/phy211/practice-exam-1.pdf}. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find two problems on the practice exam that involve motion in two dimensions.
		\item How is each of those problems similar to the ``soccer problem'' you had on Exam 1? How is each of them different?
	\end{enumerate}
    \item Write a problem that evaluates students' ability to analyze motion in two dimensions, similar to the ``soccer problem'' from Exam 1 and the two problems you identified on Practice Exam 1. Just like the ``soccer problem'', this should involve the use of the quadratic formula where you will need to consider which root you will need to choose. Then solve it. {\it (Particularly good problems here will earn extra credit!)}
\end{enumerate}
