**Announcements**

Welcome to Physics 211! This is the main course website; I will post announcements, homework, preparation 
materials, and the like here. Lecture notes will be linked from the calendar.

Before Thursday's class, you should:

* Go to recitation, meet your groupmates, and learn your TA's name and email address
* Read the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, particularly the section on the course philosophy
* Get a copy of the <a href="syllabus.html#books">textbook</a> from either an online merchant or the bookstore
* Get a clicker (the bookstore told you that you needed one, right? ;-) )

The first homework assignment is <a href="hw/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a>, due next Wednesday.
