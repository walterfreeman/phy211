\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The Facebook announcement}}
It has come to my attention that the TA's made at least some, and potentially quite a few, grading errors on the exams.

\medskip

I was not able to supervise all of the grading directly, and one of my TA's brought to my attention that multiple students in his recitation received little credit for answers that contained quite a lot of physics that was correct.

\medskip

This makes me question the accuracy of the grades you received.

\medskip

While this has happened before, I haven't heard about it happening to this extent. I promise I'll make everything fair in the end and correct any mistakes the TA's made, but there is only one of me, and this will be a great deal of work; please have patience with me as I fix things.

If you believe that your grade is not fair for any problem, I encourage you to appeal it. You might speak to your recitation TA or coach to see if they agree. There is a grade appeal form which will be posted tonight on the course website, and I will give you more information in class tomorrow.

\medskip

I will be holding my normal office hours tomorrow. However, I will hold extended office hours Friday from 10AM to 6PM in room 215 (my office), with a break for lunch from noon to 12:45; you may come and ask me to regrade problems in person. I don't know how many of you there will be; if there is huge demand, I will work as quickly as possible, but I will take as much time as needed to ensure that all the grades are fair.

\medskip

Grading you fairly and teaching you as much physics as possible are my highest priorities.
