In the ``ordered pair'' notation for vectors' components, you might write:

But this is clunky, if you're trying to write it as part of an algebraic statement.

Instead we introduce ``unit vectors'', vectors with length 1, in the x, y, and z directions.

\hat i =& (1,0,0) \\
\hat j =& (0,1,0) \\
\hat k =& (0,0,1)
