    <h3 id="1-overview-and-philosophy">1. Overview and philosophy</h3>

<p>In times like these, our focus as instructors changes somewhat. As always, our primary focus will be on ensuring that all students can learn as much physics as possible, and that you are prepared for future classes in engineering and physics. However, we will be focusing even more intently on ensuring that all students are supported and welcomed in what we build. This will require flexibility: what works for one student may not work for another. We will do our best to provide you opportunities to learn physics in a lot of different modes, and to do this as well as possible we will need your feedback. So, if there is something that’s not working for you, or not accessible to you, <strong>please let us know</strong>, and we’ll fix it.</p>

<p>The main platforms for online work (the ones all students are expected to have access to) will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blackboard</strong>: used for submitting work; used for Blackboard Collaborate for interacting in real time with each other; used for posting your grades. All materials 
will be posted to Blackboard as well (although they might be delayed for a few hours compared to the website).</li>
  <li><strong>The course website</strong>, at <a href="https://walterfreeman.github.io/phy211/">https://walterfreeman.github.io/phy211/</a> , where we will continue to post all materials for you</li>
</ul>

<p>We will likely maintain a presence on other platforms – for instance, the course Discord server (invite link: <a href="https://discord.gg/dcM4DYM">https://discord.gg/dcM4DYM</a>), a Twitch channel, a YouTube channel, or a Tencent Video channel. We are doing this so you can interact with your fellow students and instructors on platforms you may already be familiar with because you use them socially. However, all of these things are optional; you may do everything on Blackboard and with email if you want.</p>

<p>Please be patient and flexible with us and give us feedback (in #feedback on Discord or by email) if we can do anything to make this experience better for you all.</p>

<h3 id="2-grading">2. Grading</h3>

<p>Grades serve three roles in a university.</p>

<p>First, they give students a way to evaluate their progress. Someone who earns a 90 on an exam can be confident that they have learned the material well; someone who earns a 50 knows that they have work to do.</p>

<p>Second, they can serve as a motivation to think deeply and learn more, since students know that they will earn, in the end, a token of their hard work.</p>

<p>Third, they allow us to evaluate students and communicate that to others. An A in PHY211 certifies that a student is prepared to study further physics and engineering; an overall GPA of 3.8 certifies that someone has learned and achieved a great deal in their time at Syracuse.</p>

<p>In the midst of this crisis, we want to preserve the first and second roles of grading for honest, hardworking students, but not focus on the third. We absolutely do not want to hinder someone’s academic career simply because online coursework doesn’t work out for them. So, to that end, we are designing the grading systems for the remainder of the class with the <em>honest, hardworking student</em> in mind: we want your grades to serve as a source of motivation and self-reflection, but <strong>absolutely not</strong> as something that brings more stress to you. If, as a result of this, someone passes PHY211 without actually knowing much physics, this doesn’t keep me up at night; someone else, in a calmer time, will figure that out. At this point, we’re only interested in being supportive and helping you learn.</p>

<h4 id="grade-insurance">Grade insurance</h4>

<p>There may be some students for whom online classes simply don’t work out at all. Maybe they don’t have a safe place to go home to; maybe they don’t have a stable internet connection; maybe they don’t have anything to access the internet with other than a cellphone.</p>

<p>We of course will work with <strong>anyone</strong> who brings issues like this to our attention. However, to avoid the transition to online classes causing any otherwise good students to fail, and to alleviate folks’ anxiety about grades, we want to ensure everyone that your grade
at the end of the semester won’t be too far below your grade before Spring Break.</p>

<p>We don’t know exactly how we will do this yet. However, we will guarantee that if you were passing before Spring Break, you will pass the class.</p>

<h3 id="3-modifications-of-course-components">3. Modifications of course components</h3>

<p>These are the current plans for the components of our course. These may change as we learn how to better serve you all; we will be as flexible as we can.</p>

<p>As a general rule, while we encourage students to participate in recitation and lecture “synchronously” (i.e.  participating in real time using Blackboard Collaborate),
we are designing everything so that students who can only participate “asynchronously” will be able to succeed in our class. This means that even if you are not able
to be with us online, you can still get all the content, do all the work, and ask for help without live videoconferencing.</p>

<h4 id="lecture">Lecture</h4>

<p>Lectures will be given live over Blackboard Collaborate, where you can ask questions (by typing text or virtually raising your hand and asking it with voice) and get answers in realtime. They will be held at 9:30 and at 11:00 Syracuse time. You may attend whichever you prefer. We will try to have assistants there during lecture times as well, so someone can answer questions in chat.</p>

<p>Blackboard Collaborate can automatically record and post video. So, there will be recordings of the lectures available to you on Blackboard.</p>

<p>Prof. Freeman will record them and post them to YouTube; we will get copies to Tencent Video and other sites if there is a need.  PDF versions of the notes will continue to be available</p>

<h4 id="pre-lecture-questions">Pre-lecture questions</h4>

<p>These will continue as before. Note that anyone who gets even 30-40% of them right will get 100% on that portion of the grade, so if you’ve forgotten them from time to time or had tech problems, it won’t count against you.</p>

<h4 id="recitation">Recitation</h4>

<p>This will be the most complex aspect of our class to move online, but it will be the most important.</p>

<p>Recitations will be held online on Blackboard Collaborate. Recitations will be held at all of the normally-scheduled times (8:25, 9:30, 10:35, 11:40, 12:45, 14:15, 15:45, and 17:15 Syracuse time). We would prefer that you attend recitation at the time you have been all semester. However, if that won’t work for you (because you have changed timezones or for another reason), you may come to recitation at another time.</p>

<p>Regardless, we strongly encourage you to have a group of colleagues that you work well with, and come to recitation with them; we will make sure you can work together.</p>

<p>If you aren’t able to work together with people in recitation, you may as a last resort do the recitation materials yourself, or do them alongside other people from our class by collaborating over other tools (Discord, GroupMe, WeChat, FaceTime, email, etc.)</p>

<p>In any event, we will ask you to write a few-sentence summary of your recitation work and submit it as a Blackboard assignment. This should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who you worked with, how, and when</li>
  <li>how well you understood the material after you got done</li>
  <li>if there’s anything you still don’t understand</li>
  <li>any feedback about how well the online recitation worked for you</li>
</ul>

<p>An example:</p>

<p><em>I worked with Dan and Alicia during the usual 9:30 recitation section on Collaborate. We didn’t quite get done, so I finished up on my own. I understood almost everything, but I’m still a little confused on how to calculate the work done by friction in 3c. This went pretty well, but it was hard to write on the shared whiteboard without a stylus. I had to type things out with the text tool like on a graphing calculator.</em></p>

<p>Even if you do the recitation problems alone, without working with other people on Collaborate, you should still send in one of these. They will be how we give you your participation credit.</p>

<p>We are planning on posting video solutions to all the recitation problems at the end of the week when you will be doing them.</p>

<h4 id="guidance-for-using-collaborate">Guidance for using Collaborate</h4>

<p>We will post the PDF of the recitation materials that week in advance; please download them in advance of coming to recitation. Unless you have a tablet with a stylus, you should also have pencil and paper handy to write with. If you have a printer, you may also choose to print them and write on them.</p>

<p>At times when a lot of people have recitation, we will have two different Blackboard Collaborate sessions available for you to join. Please join the one that matches you; we will sort either by name or by “I have a group of people I want to work with” vs. “Please assign me to a group”.</p>

<p>Make sure you’re familiar with how to turn your microphone on and off. Please use headphones if you have them; if you’re in a loud place or don’t have headphones, please keep your mic muted except when talking.</p>

<p>The best way to work together is for one person to click on “Share Content”, “Share Files”, add the PDF of the week’s recitation activity, wait a few seconds for it to upload and convert, and then click “Share Now”. Then you can all write on the document, using either the text tool (the big T in the toolbox) or by writing with a stylus or your finger.</p>

<h4 id="homework">Homework</h4>

<p>You will do your homework as normal. You can do it either on paper or as a digitally-prepared file in whatever format you wish. You’ll submit it to an assignment on Blackboard; we will grade it electronically and give you feedback that way.</p>

<p>We are planning on posting video solutions to all the homework problems two days after they are due.</p>

<h4 id="the-paper">The paper</h4>

<p>We are going ahead with the paper. It will be assigned around the first of April and due around the end of April.</p>

<h4 id="exams">Exams</h4>

<p>Your exams (including the final) will be held on the scheduled days. However, they’ll be extended-time exams; you will have 24 hours to do them. They may be slightly more in-depth than the in-class exams we did, but they shouldn’t take a well-prepared student more than two hours to do.</p>

<p>You may do them either by writing on the PDF with a stylus (as long as it is very clear and legible), by printing them out and writing on them, or by writing on your own paper. You will submit them to Blackboard as with your homework.</p>

<p>During the exams, you may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use any notes from this course, or anything you have written down beforehand</li>
  <li>refer to your textbook</li>
  <li>consult any reference materials from this class, including any of the videos we have posted of recitation solutions, lectures, slides, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consult other online references</li>
  <li>collaborate with anyone else</li>
</ul>

<p>You are entirely on your honor to take your exams honestly. Remember the philosophy about grades that we are embracing: we are designing our course to maximize what motivated, honest students can learn. If someone cheats on an exam and gets a grade that they did not earn, then they are only hurting themselves. It is not our job at this point to figure out who is qualified to continue in engineering or science education; we are taking the approach that our job now is to help you all learn as much physics as you can in a time of crisis and to be as supportive and encouraging as possible, not to serve as gatekeepers.</p>

<h4 id="group-exams">Group exams</h4>

<p>There will be no formal Group Exam 3; instead, we will post the group exam as a set of practice problems and let you all work through them on your own in groups during the day. 
We will be available on Collaborate to help you and facilitate you working in groups, as usual. We will omit the portion of your final grade allocated to Group Exam 3.</p>

<h4 id="the-physics-clinic">The Physics Clinic</h4>

<p>The Physics Clinic is going virtual as well. It is being held as a Zoom meeting rather than on Collaborate since it is department-wide, and is being set up by Jenny Ross (associate chair). We will send you more instructions about that next week.</p>

<h4 id="help-hours">Help hours</h4>

<p>We (professors, TA’s, coaches) will also be available often for live help on Collaborate. We’ll set up sessions that you may join, and will often stay connected so you can pop in and ask us things. We can also be reached by email or on the class Discord server. Discord is a great place for you to communicate with your peers. However, if you can’t access it (perhaps because you are behind the Chinese government’s firewall), you can still get help from your instructors and peers in many other ways.</p>

<h3 id="4-what-if-you-get-sick">4. What if you get sick?</h3>

<p>It is entirely possible that someone in our class will become seriously ill due to COVID-19 or another condition.</p>

<p>If you become seriously ill and are unable to participate meaningfully in our class for an extended period, then you may 
take an incomplete grade in our course.</p>

<p>An incomplete is a “grade pending” status that allows you to finish up the course in the future and then receive a grade.</p>

<p>If you think that you may need to take an incomplete, please contact us as soon as possible. We may ask for medical documentation.</p>
