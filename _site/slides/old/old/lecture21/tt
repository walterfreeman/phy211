A 4m-long pole of mass 80 kg extends from the side of a building, angled at 60 degrees above the horizontal. One meter from the end of the pole, a sign of mass 50 kg is attached. To support the pole,
a horizontal cable runs from the end of the pole to the building. (See the attached figure.)

\it

a) Draw a force diagram on the back of this page, showing all of the elements needed to help you compute the tension in the support cable. Indicate 
your choice of pivot point. (5 points)

\bigskip

b) Compute the tension in the cable. (15 points)

\vspace{2 in}

c) Suppose now that the store owner wanted to attach the cable to a different point on the building in order to minimize its tension. What angle between the 
cable and the horizontal would support the pole with the minimum tension? (5 points)
