  <div class="post-content">
    <h1 id="physics-211-staff-manual">Physics 211 Staff Manual</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Physics 211 teaching team! This document will serve both as an introduction to your duties and as a reference during the semester.</p>

<p>This document is written for both TA’s and coaches. Students will also be able to read it, for transparency.</p>

<p><em>This is possibly the most important TA assignment in the whole department.</em> Students in your recitation sections will be exploring physics for the first time, and you will be the most valuable guide that they will have. This class is a large undertaking: we have five hundred students and a teaching team of more than thirty people, all working toward a common purpose: helping five hundred new students gain both physics skills and an appreciation for the beauty of our field. We want them to leave our class knowing the basics of Newtonian mechanics – but also thinking that physicists are friendly people and that physics is a field they can succeed in and that welcomes them.</p>

<h3 id="collegiality">Collegiality</h3>

<p>We’ll all be working closely together this semester (professors, TA’s, coaches, and students), and it’s vitally important that we do this in a supportive, collegial, positive way. This is always true, but it is even more crucial as we return to a rigorous and “down-to-business” approach after the pandemic,
while simultaneously dealing with Omicron.</p>

<p>GTA’s and coaches are <em>junior professional instructors</em>, not minions. You all will have your own ideas about how best to run things in your own recitations. That’s fantastic: as teaching professionals in your own right, you <em>should</em> have your own ideas and act on them.
If you want to “get off script” – if you see a need to do something different than we’ve planned in order to best help your students learn – please feel free to do it! (Let us know afterwards, of course!) 
Any input or feedback you have on our course is extremely valuable.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions for how we can improve things, please let me know. You will have good ideas; please present those to the rest of us! Likewise, you will recognize some of my suggestions as bad ideas – please tell me so!</p>

<p>Also, if you need help or support of any kind – someone to cover your class while you’re sick or while you study for a hard exam, advice for any issues that arise, or even just someone to talk to about your career plans and 
challenges – please ask. We will have sufficient staff that we can get you reinforcements and flexibility if you need them.</p>

<h3 id="your-roles">Your Roles</h3>

<p>In our class, TA’s will have a few main duties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lead recitation sections (your main role)</li>
  <li>Hold Clinic hours</li>
  <li>Assist students as you are able on Discord</li>
  <li>Collaborate with the teaching team in weekly staff meetings</li>
  <li>Supervise coaches in your recitation sections</li>
  <li>Grade homework assignments</li>
  <li>Provide feedback about students’ performance in recitation</li>
  <li>Proctor and grade exams</li>
</ul>

<p>Coaches will focus on the aspects of this that relate to teaching:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help students learn physics in recitations</li>
  <li>Hold office hours if you are comfortable doing so</li>
  <li>Assist students on Discord</li>
  <li>Collaborate with the teaching team in staff meetings</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll discuss each of these in detail at the end. Coaches – if you ever want more or fewer working hours (since you are paid by the hour), please let me know and we can either reduce your workload 
or find more stuff for you to do. T</p>

<h3 id="interacting-with-students">Interacting With Students</h3>

<p>University life can be hard, and we need to strike a good balance between ensuring our students work hard to learn physics and recognizing that sometimes other things will intrude on our classroom. 
Most students are at the age where psychological problems like depression and anxiety naturally manifest. If you notice any of our students showing signs of emotional distress, 
or disengaging from class (not attending, showing up but not working), please let Walter know. We’ll contact the student and see what kind of support they need.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise, if you or anyone else on the teaching staff is having a hard time (with this class that you are teaching, with your other classes that you are taking, 
or other things happening in your life), please let me know. <em>We will help you</em> – I have gone to the mat to support physics coaches/TA’s who need help and I’ll do it again if you need anything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many students see coursework as a minefield of “wrong answers” through which they must walk in order to find the elusive “right answer”. 
This mentality is <strong>not helpful</strong>, and leads to students associating error with failure. We all know this isn’t the case, 
but we need to be vigilant to make sure we’re not perpetuating this mindset that some students have. Thus, when you’re interacting with students:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Let the student know that you think they can succeed. (They almost certainly can!)</li>
      <li>Instead of focusing on things they did wrong, find the kernels of physical insight that they <em>do</em> have and build from there.</li>
      <li>It’s better to observe them working in their groups and point out mistakes at that point – physics is a process, not a set of answers, and we can help them learn best if we can diagnose their misconceptions from that process rather than only the finished product.</li>
      <li>On homework, when possible, give them insight into the nature of their errors. Remember: <strong>errors do not mean the student is a failure</strong> – they just give us insight on what the student has yet to learn.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if a student is <strong>not</strong> putting forth effort or making an earnest attempt to understand physics, it is not your fault and you shouldn’t take it personally.
We cannot put in the work required to learn physics for our students. They have to do the work; if they’re not willing to do that, it’s not our problem. If a hardworking
student would benefit from our hard work to help them – we should work hard for them. If a student who is not engaged or not trying asks for us to rearrange the course
to accommodate their laziness, then we have better things to do. (We should still treat them with basic dignity, of course, but they may wind up with a dignified failing grade.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Harassment, exclusion, bullying, and the like are not acceptable in our class.</strong> Physics has a place for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they come from. 
If you see any dynamics that act to exclude anyone from feeling welcome – including pathological group dynamics where one person railroads everyone else, 
or one person doesn’t have a chance to contribute – please intervene if you can and/or contact Walter. Likewise, if you see that a student needs accommodations
to fully benefit from our class and feel welcome, please let me know so I can fix the problem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="health-and-safety">Health and Safety</h3>

<h4 id="sick-time-covid-vaccinations">Sick time; COVID vaccinations</h4>

<p>Coaches earn one hour of sick time for every thirty hours worked. This means that, for every thirty hours you work, you may miss one hour of work due to illness and still get paid for it.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>time spent getting a COVID vaccine, traveling to a vaccination site, or recuperating from its effects counts – if you have to miss a shift because you are getting your COVID booster shot, claim it as sick time!</li>
  <li>mental illness, or things necessary for your mental wellbeing, count</li>
  <li>take your sick time; you are entitled to it by law, and it does <em>not</em> cost the Physics Department any extra for you to take it. (It’s already been paid for.)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="backups-coverage-and-support">Backups, coverage, and support</h4>

<p>We expect you to prioritize your health and wellbeing over Physics 211. If you are ill, experiencing a great deal of stress,
are not able to get enough sleep, etc., please let me or the head TA know. We will get coverage for you during your
section, get you some backup in grading, or whatever it is that you need. I can’t emphasize this enough: 
<strong>please ask for support</strong>. We have lots of people teaching this class and we <em>can</em> get someone there to back you up if you need it.</p>

<h4 id="dealing-with-emergencies">Dealing With Emergencies</h4>

<p>If you are going to miss a recitation section and have advance warning, swap with another TA; that’s not a problem. If you are in isolation with COVID, this is how we will handle it.</p>

<p>However, if you’re going to miss a recitation section without much warning – you missed your bus, you overslept, 
you have a medical emergency – then your first priority should be to <em>get someone to the classroom</em> (real or virtual) to cover for you.</p>

<p>You should do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Send a message to #phy211staff on Slack and ping @channel asking someone to cover for you. If there’s no answer in two minutes…</li>
  <li>Call Walter at (520) 409 3766.  If you can’t get him…</li>
  <li>Call the Physics Department office at (315) 443 3901 if it’s between 8am and 6pm</li>
  <li>If it becomes apparent you’re going to be more than five minutes late and nobody can cover, email your students.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a student who is being disruptive and doesn’t stop, ask them to leave your class.
If a student is being <em>extremely</em> disruptive to the point where it jeopardizes the wellbeing of the other folks in the room, 
or doesn’t leave when you ask them to, do whatever you need to do to protect your safety and the safety of your students including 
dismissing your class or calling the Department of Public Safety at (315) 443 2224. (This is very rare but I had to do it in F2021).</p>

<p><strong>Coaches</strong>: If your TA does not show up, and you are the only person there, send a quick message to Slack and ping @channel, and go on teaching. If there are multiple coaches, the most junior coach should try to contact someone while the rest teach.</p>

<h3 id="course-rhythm">Course Rhythm</h3>

<p>First, the schedule. A typical week in PHY211 will go like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monday: TA’s and coaches finish preparing for recitation exercises. Mingwei prints copies of recitation materials as needed. Staff meetings in afternoon.</li>
  <li>Tuesday: Walter teaches lecture in the morning. Another option for staff meetings. TA’s and coaches teach recitation in the evenings.</li>
  <li>Wednesday: TAs teach recitation with coaches.</li>
  <li>Thursday: Walter teaches lecture in the morning. Recitation materials for the next week planned out.</li>
  <li>Friday: TA’s teach recitation with coaches. Walter sends out a draft of recitation materials for the next week to TA’s and coaches.</li>
  <li>Weekend: TA’s and coaches begin preparing for the next week’s recitation exercises. Walter revises recitation materials if needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ta-and-coach-duties-in-detail">TA and coach duties in detail</h2>

<h3 id="recitation-sections">Recitation Sections</h3>

<p>Your chief responsibility will be to lead recitation sections. Each recitation, about twenty students will come to your classroom (real or virtual) to hone and practice the skills they have learned in lecture. 
Since physics is a particular perspective on the world and a set of analytical and mathematical skills, rather than a list of facts, 
students <em>cannot</em> learn the essence of physics without lots of practice – and without a skilled guide by their side. 
Learning physics is like learning to play the piano: all the teacher can do is provide advice, but it’s up to the 
pianist to do the hard work of sitting down at the piano and training their fingers and mind to play the instrument.</p>

<p>For each recitation, we will provide a set of activities – exercises for the students in which they analyze physical situations 
that are designed to guide them through the skills they are learning. You will spend most of your time walking around the room and talking to students, 
responding to their questions, and asking them leading questions of your own designed to gently guide them toward insight.</p>

<h4 id="recitation-feedback">Recitation feedback</h4>

<p>After each recitation section, I’d like you to take just a few minutes to provide some feedback about how the students are doing. This may seem like a silly bit of paperwork,
but it is essential for us to keep tabs on how things are going and make changes as needed.</p>

<h4 id="group-work">Group work</h4>

<p>On the first day of class, have the students self-sort into groups of three. These groups should be pretty persistent from section to section, but if there are complaints, some fluidity is fine. It can be
better if students from minoritized groups (women/nonbinary folks, minoritized races) work with other people who share their identity if possible, but if they find other groupmates,
this is fine too.</p>

<p>Groups of two are okay; groups of four are okay only in exceptional circumstances (i.e. there are 3n students in stable groups and then one more student shows up and needs a group).</p>

<p><strong>You shouldn’t spend much time lecturing</strong>; do this only if there is some concept that most of your class doesn’t understand. 
Since our objective is for students to gain confidence and skill in figuring things out for themselves, 
they should spend most of their time actively working with each other.</p>

<p>If all the students don’t finish all the recitation materials in the class period, that’s fine; often we will write more materials than most of the students will need, since we don’t want students to “run out of things to learn”.</p>

<h4 id="recitation-evaluation">Recitation Evaluation</h4>

<p>Each day, you should keep a log of your students’ attendance and participation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>0/3: absent, or present and not contributing, for most of recitation</li>
  <li>1/3: participating marginally, or absent for much of class</li>
  <li>2/3: working but without full engagement with their group</li>
  <li>3/3: working together to learn physics with their group</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="absences-excuses-and-accommodations">Absences, excuses, and accommodations</h4>

<p>(to be completed)</p>

<h3 id="a-word-on-coaches-for-the-tas">A word on coaches, for the TA’s</h3>

<p>You’ll have some undergraduate coaches in your recitation section as well. These folks are people who have taken PHY211 in the past and are now working as part of the teaching team. In my experience the coaches are often the best instructors we have – better than I am, and better than you are – because they were so recently students themselves and remember what it’s like to learn this stuff for the first time. They will mostly do the same things you will do – talk to students, respond to raised hands, and answer students’ questions.</p>

<p>However, even though the coaches will often be better instructors than we are, we generally know more physics than they do. Part of your job is to serve as an “expert in the room”; if the coaches are presenting things to students in a way that is confusing or incorrect, you will have the background needed to clarify things. Generally the coaches are excellent, but if you encounter a situation where a coach is regularly unprepared or leading students astray, please let me know so I can steer things back on course.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-staff-meetings">Weekly Staff Meetings</h2>

<p>We’ll schedule two staff meetings on Monday and Tuesday at times that accommodate everyone. You will need to come to one or the other each week. During those meetings, we’ll discuss how things have gone in the previous week and what we’re teaching them in class. We’ll have a series of coaches work through the exercises for the upcoming week, and discuss what aspects of the exercises the students will likely find challenging, what we’re trying to teach them, and how to help them.</p>

<p>This also serves as good practice for everyone, especially in the situation where a coach makes a mistake. In that event, respond to them like you would one of the students: don’t just tell them the answer, but ask them leading questions to help their understanding. Remember: we are all here to support each other, and errors do not mean a lack of skill or qualification to teach.</p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

<p>Homework in this class is purely traditional (i.e. long-answer questions). They will submit 
homework to you in recitation.</p>

<p>In each homework set, you will grade two problems out of ten points and examine the solution for correctness, using the following rubric:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10: solution correct and well-explained</li>
  <li>9: solution mostly correct, but has minor flaws in the solution or its explanation that do not reflect a deficiency in physics knowledge</li>
  <li><strong>8: a fully correct solution that is not explained well</strong> (see below)</li>
  <li>7-8: solution reflects physical insight and a basic understanding of the principles, but with errors that <em>do</em> reflect a flaw in physics knowledge</li>
  <li>5-6: solution partially correct, but with significant deficits that prevent the student from completing the problem, or significant omissions</li>
  <li>less than 5: some work that indicates knowledge, but not significant progress to a solution</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that even a fully correct solution that isn’t explained well can get no higher than 8/10. 
To count as “well explained”, someone who doesn’t already know the solution must be able to 
look at the student’s work and clearly see what they are doing and understand why. Most commonly
this explanation will take the form of words combined with algebra; in some cases extremely 
well-organized algebra with descriptive names can be self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that in this class, the breakpoints between A/B/C/D/F are 80/65/55/50.</p>

<p>You should deduct significant credit for solutions that have numbers substituted in for variables too early (so they consist of lines of arithmetic that makes little narrative sense rather than algebra that shows what the student is doing and thinking), even if the final answer is correct.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Many parts of questions will ask students to explain things in words rather than symbols. <em>Do not gloss over these</em>. If a student’s explanation is fragmented, weak, or incoherent, <em>please</em> deduct significant credit 
for the entire problem – especially early in the semester. Many students underestimate the necessity of communicating clearly about physics in words, not just in mathematics; these students often find themselves unable to do the
mathematics either because they do not develop physical reasoning skills. Deduct significant credit and tell them why.</p>

<p>You will grade the remaining problems out of two points. This shouldn’t take you long; you are basically looking to see if the student made an honest attempt at the problem. Use the following rubric:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2: a solution which could be correct</li>
  <li>1: a partial solution or a good start on the problem</li>
  <li>0: Nothing, or nothing substantive</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="maintaining-gradebooks">Maintaining Gradebooks</h4>

<p>We will create a column in Blackboard for students’ recitation numbers. When entering grades,
you may sort Blackboard by recitation number; this will let you You are responsible for grading your students’ homework and tracking their recitation participation. 
If a student has a question or complaint about their grade, you have authority to change their grades within reason. If there is a clear error in a student’s exam grade, you can fix it.</p>

<p>Every week, we will ask you for an update on your grading. If you are a bit behind on grading, that is not a big deal. But if you are falling seriously behind, <em>ask for help</em>.</p>

<p>If a student wants to <em>appeal</em> their exam grade, then you can either hear their appeal (but not during recitation when other students need you!) or send them to me. However, if they are appealing something other than an arithmetic error, you can ask them to work the problem out for you without notes, live. 
Their grade should be based solely on what they wrote down during the exam, but per the class policy in order to hear <em>any</em> appeal, they first need to demonstrate that they know what a correct solution is.</p>

<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>

<p>We will have three midterm mini-exams and a final.</p>

<p>We’ll need proctors on those days in class to answer student questions (who may be TA’s or coaches). During the final we’ll need everyone or nearly everyone to help proctor.</p>

<!--
### Paper Grading

We will be discussing the process of science in our class, and students will write a paper on pseudoscience/science denialism later in the term. You'll be responsible for grading these papers. We'll talk about this more as the time comes, but this is coming sometime in April and will be a fair bit of work.-->
