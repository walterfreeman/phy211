## Exam 3

Here are the five PDF's for the five parts of Exam 3.

[Question 1 (short answer) and instructions](exam3-2020-problem1.pdf)<br>
[Question 2](exam3-2020-problem2.pdf)<br>
[Question 3](exam3-2020-problem3.pdf)<br>
[Question 4](exam3-2020-problem4.pdf)<br>
[Question 5](exam3-2020-problem5.pdf)

<br><br>

You may also download [the whole exam in one PDF for easy printing](exam3-2020.pdf), but we would still like you to submit each problem separately on Blackboard to help us grade.

Submit these to the assignments under ``Exam'' on Blackboard by Wednesday, 1:00 PM Syracuse time (EDT, UTC -4:00).

### Practice Exam 3

<a href="practiceexam3-2020.pdf">Practice Exam 3</a> for recitation Friday. A video of the review session, including full solutions, is on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/nmgPsaXk19s). We will get Bilibili / alternate hosting availability as soon as possible.

### Exam 3 from 2019

Some students asked for <a href="exam3-2019.pdf">Exam 3 from 2019</a>. Note that this exam covers a few topics that aren't in this unit this year (angular momentum, rotational kinetic energy); this was a particularly hard exam last year.

A better assessment of what this year's exam will be like will be the practice exam (above).

### Unit 3 Review

Some of you were asking me to write a review of this unit. Here you go: [Unit 3 review](unit-3-review.pdf)

### Video library

We will be posting all of the videos from class on YouTube, Bilibili, and (hopefully) Blackboard. You can find links in the [video library](videos.html).


### The Virtual Physics Clinic

The Physics Clinic has gone virtual on Zoom. Here is the <a href="clinic-description.pdf">general description</a> of how it will
work, and a <a href="clinic-faq">Virtual Clinic FAQ</a> with answers to some common questions.

The part of the Virtual Clinic run by the Physics Department will run from 1-7 PM Syracuse time Monday through Thursday, and 1-5 PM Syracuse time on Friday. 

However, PHY211 will have additional help hours as well to accommodate people's schedules and time zones. If you would like us to meet with you at a 
specific time, tell us, and we'll get you help at that time!

You can join the Virtual Clinic at <a href="https://zoom.us/j/668912935">https://zoom.us/j/668912935</a>. If you don't have Zoom
already, you may be prompted to download a small program.


### Upcoming assignments:

<a href="hw/hw11-2020.pdf">Homework 11 is posted</a> and is due Tuesday, April 7.

### Upcoming help hours

Walter will be in the Virtual Clinic on Friday, April 3, from 8AM to 10AM; Matt will be in the Virtual Clinic from 1PM to 3PM on the same day.
