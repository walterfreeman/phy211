Physics: what are the fundamental laws of nature?

These phenomena are all governed by the {\it same few principles}.
\end{center}
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Mechanics}}

The most fundamental question physics asks:

\bigskip

\Large \centerline{\color{Red}``Why do things move in the ways that they do?''}


\bigskip

\normalsize

The answer is given by Isaac Newton's second law of motion:


\bigskip

\begin{center}
\Large {\color{Blue} ``Objects accelerate when pushed by forces; they accelerate in the direction of the force, proportional to the size of the force divided by their mass.''}
\end{center}
\normalsize


\bigskip

That's it. We will spend much of our class talking about the meaning and consequences of this one statement.

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The physicist's eye}}

\large

Physics is about {\color{Blue} understanding complicated things in terms of simple pieces}, like Newton's law.

\pause
\bigskip

The perspective of physics is one that looks at a situation and asks:

\begin{itemize}
\item{``What phenomena are involved in this thing?''}
\item{``How do they interact to determine its behavior?''}
\end{itemize}
\pause
\bigskip

In this class, you'll learn about some of those simple pieces, but that's not the important thing.

\bigskip

You'll also learn the skill of asking those two questions, and develop {\color{Blue}a physicist's perspective for solving problems}.

\bigskip

This will serve you well in whatever field you pursue, since the ability to quickly look at a problem and understand the crucial 
elements is universally helpful.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Lots and lots of stars...}
\item{They exert forces on each other through gravity}
\pause
\item{Those forces cause accelerations: $\vec F = m \vec a$ (don't worry, you'll learn about the arrows)}
\item{Those accelerations then affect the stars' motion}
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item{The accelerations change the stars' speed and direction of travel}

\item{Kinematics (understanding the right hand side of $\vec F=m \vec a$)}
\begin{itemize}
\item{How do we describe motion?}
\item{How do an object's position, velocity, and acceleration relate?}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Clickers}}
Starting next week, we'll start using clickers in class, and the week after that,
your participation in clicker questions wil be graded.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Clickers are little radio devices you can use to answer questions in class}
\item{You can also use a smartphone or tablet}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

You will need to either:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Buy a Turning Technologies clicker from the bookstore or elsewhere, or}
\item{... download the ResponseWare app on your smartphone, then set up an account and buy a license
for \$20 (cheaper than a clicker)}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Mastering Physics}}
\large
Mastering Physics is an online homework system. Due to negative feedback from students I
don't require it, but it is still for sale in the bookstore; you do not need to buy it.}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Grading}}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Homework: 30\% (submitted to your recitation TA)}
\item{Exams: 50\%}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Each of the three sections has an exam}
\item{{\color{Red}Every exam has a makeup given two weeks later}}
\item{{\color{Green}You can take both and keep the higher grade}}
\end{itemize}
\item{Class participation (clicker questions): 5\%}
\item{Computational projects (mostly done in recitation): 10\%}
\item{Recitation attendance: 5\%}
\item{Up to 2\% extra credit for participation in course Facebook group}
\item{Up to 2\% extra credit for exceptional participation in recitations, etc.}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{How to do well in this class (important!)}}
\Large
\centerline{This class isn't about learning facts or memorizing equations!}
\pause
\bigskip
\large
In this class, I hope you will:
\BI
\item{... learn to look at moving things around you in a new, rigorous way}
\pause
\item{... learn to solve problems by taking them apart, understanding the parts, and putting them back together again}
\pause
\item{... learn to translate between and combine verbal, visual, and mathematical descriptions of things, while still being precise}
\pause
\EI

\centerline{These things are skills, and they all require practice}
\centerline{... but they also require you to ask questions and ask for guidance!}
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{How to do well in this class: ask for guidance!}}
\Large
\begin{center}
Some students might come to class, write down everything,
go home and review, and then spend hours alone working on the homework...
\end{center}
\pause

\bigskip

\centerline{... but this is not the best way to learn skills! Instead, I hope you will:}

\item{Do your homework in the Physics Clinic when you can}
\EI
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Metaphors: sports and music}}
\large

Learning physics is like learning to play a musical instrument.

\bigskip

The hard part isn't learning the notes -- it's being able to play them, and tell a story with them.

\bigskip

How does studying the piano work?

\begin{itemize}
\item{Your teacher shows you a few techniques, and gives you a piece to learn to play}
\item{You take it home, practice it, and get stuck on difficult parts}
\item{You ask your teacher for advice; she guides you}
\item{You practice some more}
\item{You repeat the previous steps until you've mastered the technique and the music}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Learning a sport works the same way.

\bigskip

Physics is like this. We don't expect you to master everything immediately; physics takes practice, and it's
okay to get stuck and ask questions. In fact, it's what I expect!
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The Physics Clinic}}
\large
The Clinic is in room 112; it's a large room with tables, boards, and (usually) a graduate teaching 
assistant.

\bigskip

You can go there whenever the building is open to work in groups on your homework, and
ask each other and the GTA for help.


\bigskip

I also hold my office hours there.

\bigskip

This is an excellent resource for you to use; why do your homework alone when you can work
with your peers and instructors?
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Office hours}}
\Large
In the Physics Clinic:
\BI
\item{Mondays: 10-12 AM}
\item{Tuesdays: 4-6 PM}
\item{Thursdays: 1:30-3:30 PM}
\item{Fridays: 2:00-4:00 PM}
\EI

or by appointment.  
\bigskip
\bigskip

Outside these times you might find me in the Clinic or in my office in room 215.

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Equations of motion}}
\large
Complete description of motion: ``Where is my object at each point in time?''

\bigskip

This corresponds to a mathematical function. Two ways to represent these. Suppose I drop
a ball off a building, putting the origin at the ground and calling ``up'' the positive direction:

\bigskip
\bigskip

\column{0.5\textwidth}

(C is some number; we'll learn what it is Thursday)

\end{columns}

\centerline{Both let us answer questions like ``When does the object hit the ground?''}

\bigskip

\begin{columns}

\centerline {\color{Red}\large $\rightarrow$ ... the curve's x-intercept}
\column{0.5\textwidth}
\centerline{\color{Blue} \large $\rightarrow$ ... when $y(t)=0$}
\end{columns}

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Velocity: how fast position changes}}
\large
The slope of the position vs. time curve has a special significance. Here's one with a constant slope:

\medskip

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{constant-v-crop.pdf}}

\bigskip

\pause

Slope is $\frac{{\rm rise}}{{\rm run}}$ = $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$ = $\frac{2\,\rm m}{1 \, \rm s}$ = 2 meters per second (positive;
it could well be negative!)

\bigskip \pause

{\color{Red} $\rightarrow$ The slope here -- change in position over change in time -- is the {\bf velocity}!} Note that it can be
positive or negative, depending on which way the object moves.

}


\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Constant-velocity motion: connecting graphs to algebra}}
\large
If an object moves with constant velocity, its position vs. time graph is a line:

\medskip

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{constant-v-2-crop.pdf}}

We know the equation of a straight line is is $x = mt + b$ (using $t$ and $x$ as our axes).

\BI
\item{$m$ is the slope, which we identified as the velocity}
\item{$b$ is the vertical intercept, which we recognize as the value of $x$ when $t=0$}
\EI

We can thus change the variable names to be more descriptive:

\bigskip

\centerline{\Large{{\color{Red} $x(t) = vt + x_0$} (constant-velocity motion)}}

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Going from ``equations of motion'' to answers}}

\large

{\color{Red}$x(t) = vt + x_0$} is called an {\it equation of motion}; in this case, it is valid for constant-velocity motion.

\medskip

It gives you the same information as a position vs. time graph, but in algebraic form.

\bigskip
\bigskip

\normalsize

To solve real problems, we need to be able to translate physical questions into algebraic statements:
\bigskip
\bigskip

\BI
\item{``If a car starts at milepost 30 and drives at 50 mph, where is it an hour later?''}
\pause
\BI
\item{Using $x(t) = x_0 + vt$, with $x_0=30\, {\rm mi}$ and $v = 50 \frac{\rm mi}{\rm hr}$, calculate $x$ at $t=1\, {\rm hr}$}
\EI
\pause
\item{``When does a falling object hit the ground?''}
\pause
\BI
\item{If the ground is at $y=0$, then we ask: ``What is the value of $t$ when $y=0$?''}
\EI
\pause
\item{``When do two moving objects meet?''} 
\pause
\BI
\item{Write down $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$, then ask ``At what time does $x_1 = x_2$?''}
\EI

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{A rough problem-solving guide for constant-velocity motion}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Decide on a coordinate system: where is $x=0$, and which way is positive?}
\item{Write down the equation of motion $x(t)=x_0+vt$ for each object}
\item{Ask ``How can I translate the thing I'm looking for into an algebraic statement?''}
