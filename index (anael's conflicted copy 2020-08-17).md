Good luck!

### Unit 3 and 4 Reviews

By your request I've written very condensed reviews of Units 3 and 4. There are no sample problem here -- only the laws of physics.

### Some practice problems for the final

We have put together some practice problems for the final, including some multiple choice questions. You can download those <a href="final_practice_2020.pdf">practice problems here</a>. 

### Upcoming assignments:

<a href="hw/homework14.pdf">Homework 14 is posted</a> and is due Thursday, April 30. 

The prompt for the <a href="paper.html">paper on the process of science</a> is posted.

### Most recent lecture slides

<a href="slides/lecture26-2020-MR.pdf">Final class slides from Matt Rudolph</a> and <a href="slides/lecture26-2020-WF.pdf">from Walter Freeman</a>.

### Grade prediction

I've put together a spreadsheet you can use to try to predict your end-of-term grade. You may download the grade-prognosticator spreadsheet in the native <a href="grade-prognosticator.ods">OpenDocument</a> format or in <a href="grade-prognosticator.xlsx">MS Office</a>.

### Video library

We will be posting all of the videos from class on YouTube, Bilibili, and (hopefully) Blackboard. You can find links in the [video library](videos.html).


### The Virtual Physics Clinic

The Physics Clinic has gone virtual on Zoom. Here is the <a href="clinic-description.pdf">general description</a> of how it will
work, and a <a href="clinic-faq">Virtual Clinic FAQ</a> with answers to some common questions.

The part of the Virtual Clinic run by the Physics Department will run from 1-7 PM Syracuse time Monday through Thursday, and 1-5 PM Syracuse time on Friday. 

However, PHY211 will have additional help hours as well to accommodate people's schedules and time zones. If you would like us to meet with you at a 
specific time, tell us, and we'll get you help at that time!

You can join the Virtual Clinic at <a href="https://zoom.us/j/668912935">https://zoom.us/j/668912935</a>. If you don't have Zoom
already, you may be prompted to download a small program.


### Upcoming help hours

Walter will be in the Virtual Physics Clinic on Friday from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM; Prof. Rudolph will be there from 1:00-3:00 PM
