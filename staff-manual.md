# Physics 211 Staff Manual

Welcome to the Physics 211 teaching team! This document will serve both as an introduction to your duties and as a reference during the semester.

This document is written for both TA's and coaches. Students will also be able to read it, for transparency.

*This is possibly the most important TA assignment in the whole department.* Students in your recitation sections will be exploring physics for the first time, and you will be the most valuable guide that they will have. This class is a large undertaking: we have five hundred students and a teaching team of more than thirty people, all working toward a common purpose: helping five hundred new students gain both physics skills and an appreciation for the beauty of our field. We want them to leave our class knowing the basics of Newtonian mechanics -- but also thinking that physicists are friendly people and that physics is a field they can succeed in and that welcomes them.

### Collegiality

We'll all be working closely together this semester (professors, TA's, coaches, and students), and it's vitally important that we do this in a supportive, collegial, positive way. This is always true, but it is even more crucial in the 
weird world of online classes during the pandemic.

I see GTA's and coaches as *junior professional instructors*, not as minions. You all will have your own ideas about how best to run things in your own recitations. That's fantastic: as teaching professionals in your own right, you *should* have your own ideas and act on them.
If you want to "get off script" -- if you see a need to do something different than we've planned in order to best help your students learn -- please feel free to do it! (Let us know afterwards, of course!) 
Any input or feedback you have on our course is extremely valuable. 

If you have any suggestions for how we can improve things, please let me know. You will have good ideas; please present those to the rest of us! Likewise, you will recognize some of my suggestions as bad ideas -- please tell me so! 

Also, if you need help or support of any kind -- someone to cover your class while you're sick or while you study for a hard exam, advice for any issues that arise, or even just someone to talk to about your career plans and 
challenges in grad school -- please ask. 

### Your Roles

In our class, TA's will have a few main duties:

* Lead recitation sections, mostly online, perhaps in person
* Hold one office hour per week (online or in person)
* Collaborate with the teaching team in weekly staff meetings
* Supervise coaches in your recitation sections
* Grade homework assignments
* Provide feedback about students' performance in recitation
* Proctor and grade exams
* Grade papers

Coaches will focus on the aspects of this that relate to teaching:

* Help students learn physics in recitations
* Moderate the large-class meetings and provide technical assistance (one or two coaches per day, TTh 11-12:20)
* Hold office hours if you are comfortable doing so (online or in person)
* Collaborate with the teaching team in staff meetings
* Provide students assistance with their papers if you are comfortable doing so

I'll discuss each of these in detail at the end. Coaches -- if you ever want more or fewer working hours (since you are paid by the hour), please let me know and we can either reduce your workload 
or find more stuff for you to do. T

### Interacting With Students

* This year is hard on everyone -- me, you, and our students. Everyone will have things on their mind other than physics right now, 
and we need to strike a good balance between ensuring our students work hard to learn physics and recognizing that sometimes other things will intrude on our classroom. 
Most students are at the age where psychological problems like depression and anxiety naturally manifest. If you notice any of our students showing signs of emotional distress, 
or disengaging from class (not attending, showing up but not working), please let Walter or Aaron know. We'll contact the student and see what kind of support they need.

* Likewise, if you or anyone else on the teaching staff is having a hard time (with this class that you are teaching, with your other classes that you are taking, 
or other things happening in your life), please let me know. *We will help you* -- I have gone to the mat to support physics coaches/TA's who need help and I'll
do it again if you need anything.

* Many students see coursework as a minefield of "wrong answers" through which they must walk in order to find the elusive "right answer". 
This mentality is **not helpful**, and leads to students associating error with failure. We all know this isn't the case, 
but we need to be vigilant to make sure we're not perpetuating this mindset that some students have. Thus, when you're interacting with students:

    * Let the student know that you think they can succeed. (They almost certainly can!)
    * Instead of focusing on things they did wrong, find the kernels of physical insight that they *do* have and build from there. 
    * It's better to observe them working in their groups and point out mistakes at that point -- physics is a process, not a set of answers, and we can help them learn best if we can diagnose their misconceptions from that process rather than only the finished product.
    * On homework, when possible, give them insight into the nature of their errors. Remember: **errors do not mean the student is a failure** -- they just give us insight on what the student has yet to learn.
    
* However, if a student is **not** putting forth effort or making an earnest attempt to understand physics, it is not your fault and you shouldn't take it personally.
We cannot put in the work required to learn physics for our students. They have to do the work; if they're not willing to do that, it's not our problem. If a hardworking
student would benefit from our hard work to help them -- we should work hard for them. If a student who is not engaged or not trying asks for us to rearrange the course
to accommodate their laziness, then we have better things to do. (We should still treat them with basic dignity, of course, but they may wind up with a dignified failing grade.)

* **Harassment, exclusion, bullying, and the like are not acceptable in our class.** Physics has a place for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they come from. 
If you see any dynamics that act to exclude anyone from feeling welcome -- including pathological group dynamics where one person railroads everyone else, 
or one person doesn't have a chance to contribute -- please intervene if you can and/or contact Walter or Aaron. Likewise, if you see that a student needs accommodations
to fully benefit from our class and feel welcome, please let me know so I can fix the problem.


### Health and Safety

#### Sick time; COVID vaccinations 

Coaches earn one hour of sick time for every thirty hours worked. This means that, for every thirty hours you work, you may miss one hour of work due to illness and still get paid for it.

Note:

* time spent getting a COVID vaccine, traveling to a vaccination site, or recuperating from its effects counts -- if you have to miss a shift because you are getting your COVID vaccine, claim it as sick time!
* mental illness, or things necessary for your mental wellbeing, count

#### COVID safety protocols

Everyone should wear a mask when in the halls of the Physics Building, or are in a room with people other than family and housemates. 

When working with students in person, everyone should stay 2m away from others except when necessary to see things they have written. It is permissible 
to briefly get closer to someone in order to collaborate.

Anyone who is feeling ill should not come to the building.

If anyone on the teaching staff contracts COVID, obviously you should take as much time off work as you need to recover.

#### Backups, coverage, and support

We expect you to prioritize your health and wellbeing over Physics 211. If you are ill, experiencing a great deal of stress,
are not able to get enough sleep, or something like that, please let me or Aaron know. We will get coverage for you during your
section, get you some backup in grading papers, or whatever it is that you need. I can't emphasize this enough: 
**please ask for support**. We have lots of people teaching this class and we *can* get someone there to back you up if you need it.

#### Dealing With Emergencies

If you are going to miss a recitation section and have advance warning, swap with another TA; that's not a problem.

However, if you're going to miss a recitation section without much warning -- you missed your bus, you overslept, you have a computer failure,
you have a medical emergency -- then your first priority should be to *get someone to the classroom* (real or virtual) to cover for you.

You should do the following:

* Send a message to #phy211staff on Slack asking someone to cover for you. If there's no answer in two minutes...
* Call Walter at (520) 409 3766 and then Aaron at (xxx) xxx xxxx in that order. If you can't get them...
* Call the Physics Department office at (315) 443 3901 if it's between 8am and 6pm
* If it becomes apparent you're going to be more than five minutes late and nobody can cover, email your students.

If you have a student who is being disruptive and doesn't stop, ask them to leave your class (if they are there in person) or kick them from the virtual classroom. 
If a student is being *extremely* disruptive to the point where it jeopardizes the wellbeing of the other folks in the room, 
please do whatever you need to do to protect your safety and the safety of your students, including calling the Department of Public Safety at (315) 443 2224. (This is very rare but it has happened).

If you are working in person with students and a student is not wearing a mask that covers their mouth and nose, offer them one from the classroom supply. If they don't put it on, ask them to leave 
and join the virtual classroom. If they are unwilling to do this and become confrontational, do whatever you need to protect yourself and the class, and call for backup (ping @channel in #phy211staff and/or call
the Physics Department office or Public Safety.

**Coaches**: If your TA does not show up, and you are the only person there, send a quick message to Slack and ping @channel, and go on teaching. If there are multiple coaches, the most junior coach should try to contact someone while the rest teach.


### Course Rhythm

First, the schedule. A typical week in PHY211 will go like this:

* Monday: TA's and coaches finish preparing for recitation exercises. Adam prints copies of recitation materials as needed. Staff meetings possibly Monday afternoon.
* Tuesday: Walter teaches lecture in the morning. Staff meetings in the afternoon.
* Wednesday: TAs teach recitation with coaches. Homework due.
* Thursday: Walter teaches lecture in the morning. Recitation materials for the next week planned out.
* Friday: TA's teach recitation with coaches. Homework (sometimes) due. Walter sends out a draft of recitation materials for the next week to TA's and coaches.
* Weekend: TA's and coaches begin preparing for the next week's recitation exercises. Walter revises recitation materials if needed.

On weeks when we have a quiz in class, Tuesday and Wednesday are modified:

* Tuesday: Quiz occupies half of class time. Begin grading quiz during afternoon, prioritizing students with morning recitations. Abbreviated staff meetings. *(These will be long days.)* 
* Wednesday: Recitation held as normal. Finish grading quizzes, aiming for everyone's quiz to be done by the time they come to recitation. Recitation may run with reduced TA staff to get quiz grading done.

## TA and coach duties in detail

### Recitation Sections

Your chief responsibility will be to lead recitation sections. Each Wednesday and Friday, about twenty students will come to your classroom (real or virtual) to hone and practice the skills they have learned in lecture. 
Since physics is a particular perspective on the world and a set of analytical and mathematical skills, rather than a list of facts, 
students _cannot_ learn the essence of physics without lots of practice -- and without a skilled guide by their side. 
Learning physics is like learning to play the piano: all the teacher can do is provide advice, but it's up to the 
pianist to do the hard work of sitting down at the piano and training their fingers and mind to play the instrument.

For each recitation, we will provide a set of activities -- exercises for the students in which they analyze physical situations 
that are designed to guide them through the skills they are learning. You will spend most of your time walking around the room and talking to students, 
responding to their questions, and asking them leading questions of your own designed to gently guide them toward insight. 

#### Recitation feedback

After each recitation section, I'd like you to take just a few minutes to provide some feedback about how the students are doing. This may seem like a silly bit of paperwork,
but it is essential for me to keep tabs on how things are going and make changes as needed. I'll likely do this by a Google Form that you can fill out; this should take you just a few minutes.


### Sections, TA's, and students

Each section will have multiple TA's and coaches assigned to it; we anticipate that each section may have two or three TA's, five or six coaches, and upwards of 50 students. 

All TA's and coaches in a section share responsibility for guiding the students in that section as they learn physics.

However, we'd like each student to have one TA who is primarily responsible for assessing their work; that way, when a student wants to discuss their grades, 
they have a clear idea about who to talk to. Thus, within each section, we'll divide the students among the TA's assigned to that section.

#### Recitation modalities

We will be teaching recitations in three modalities: online, blended, and in-person (in B129E).

**You may freely choose how you want to teach without any pressure from me or the Physics Department. If you are not comfortable teaching in person, you don't have to.**

**Online:** I imagine that most of our recitations will be taught online, using Blackboard Collaborate or another virtual classroom platform. You may teach online from anywhere; you will find it very useful to have a headset (or earbuds with a 
microphone) and a computer with a webcam. You will also find it _very_ helpful to have a tablet or laptop with a touchscreen and a stylus, so you can write mathematics and draw diagrams for the students. If you don't have something like this,
please ask Walter; he may be able to get you one. 

**Blended:** Some students may want to do recitations in person. We can accommodate a limited number of students in person. If only a handful of students in a section wish to work in person, and a TA or coach is willing to teach them in person,
they may work together in B129E or another room with an instructor who is there in person, but splits their time between helping those who are physically present and helping out on Blackboard Collaborate. They will need to bring online teaching 
equipment (laptop/headset/stylus/etc.) to the physical classroom, and bounce back and forth between being in front of the computer and walking around to help those who are in person. Bluetooth earbuds will be very useful if you are doing this.

**In-person:** If we have enough students who want to work in person in a section and a TA or coach is willing to teach them in person that one instructor will be dedicated to helping them alone, then that instructor can work with only the 
in-person students, and not need to multitask with online folks.


#### Group work

On the first day of class, split the students into groups of three. You may do this in any way you want. These groups should be pretty persistent from section to section, but if there are complaints, some fluidity is fine.

Groups of two are okay; groups of four are okay only in exceptional circumstances (i.e. there are 3n students in stable groups and then one more student shows up and needs a group).

You shouldn't spend much time lecturing; do this only if there is some concept that most of your class doesn't understand. 
However, since our objective is for students to gain confidence and skill in figuring things out for themselves, 
they should spend most of their time actively working.

If all the students don't finish all the recitation materials in the class period, that's fine; often we will write more materials than most of the students will need, since we don't want students to "run out of things to learn". 


#### Recitation Evaluation

A large portion of students' grades will be assigned based on recitation work. How this is done will vary from day to day, but in any event, **students must be present** (physically or virtually) to get a grade. 
My experience last semester was that trying to assign grades and assess folks' work after the fact resulted in chaos (and whining and dishonesty). So we're going to do it in recitation this semester.

Some things we might do:

**Attendance/participation check:** The easiest thing we can do is to just give them a grade based on whether they are working on physics. We will probably do this most days. 
A coach or TA will join the Blackboard Collaborate breakout room where students are working, and give each of them a grade out of two points:

* 0/2: absent, or present and not contributing, for most of recitation
* 1/2: participating marginally, or absent for much of class
* 2/2: participating fully
* 3/2: going above and beyond to ensure that their groupmates learn

**Recitation understanding quiz:** A Blackboard assignment will open about ten minutes before recitation ends and close five minutes after it ends. Students will answer a brief question or two about the things they did in recitation
that day. Some of these will be multiple choice (and thus graded automatically); some we will need
to grade manually. TAs or senior coaches may do this grading. (I have some ways to make the grading process faster to cut through Blackboard lag.) Often we will allow students to discuss these in their groups, but each student will need
to submit their own copy of the answers.

To prevent shenanigans, we will have different questions for each recitation section.

**Homework understanding quiz:** As above, but about the homework they submitted that day, rather than about the recitation material.

To prevent shenanigans, again, we will have different questions for each recitation section.

**Group conversation:** A TA may engage a group in a conversation about what they are learning, and assess people in the group based on how fluently they discuss the material they are working on. Their 
grade should be based on understanding they demonstrate at the _end_ of the conversation, not the beginning; if a student doesn't know something at the beginning of your conversation, but understands it at the end,
then they get credit. We will not be able to do this for every group on any given day; where we are able, though, this can substitute for the other sorts of evaluation. How exactly we work the logistics of this will
depend on how stable the groups wind up being; stay tuned.

**Recitation group test:** We will do more formal quizzes a few times during the semester, which will take the whole recitation period. Students may work in their groups to complete these. They will again be different for different sections. This will be the only recitation assessment type that is announced in advance.

In any event, a student _must be in recitation_ (physically or virtually) to receive a grade by any of the preceding. What if they're not? That's the next section.

#### Absences, excuses, and accommodations

Some students will need to miss recitation for various reasons. We need to accommodate this, but we do not want students to abuse this process. **No student who misses recitation may get a recitation grade by
the normal process for that day**.
This is a hard-and-fast rule: *if you do not show up to your recitation*, you may not just "fill out the quiz later". We will be allowing makeups, but those _must be done over video call or in-person_: this means
that a student must talk to you and answer questions you ask them about the recitation activity live.

Instead, students must do one of the following:

* **Attend a different recitation section**: Four times during the semester, a student can go to a different recitation than the one they are enrolled in and complete the assessment for that section rather than their own. 

* **Attend a makeup recitation section**: We will schedule some makeup recitation times on Mondays. Students who miss recitation may attend a makeup recitation and do the recitation material from the previous week. During or after that 
makeup recitation, we will give them a verbal assessment (a conversation to ensure they understand what they are doing) and grade on the spot.

* **Have a conversation during office hours**: They may show up to office hours (TA's or Walter's) within a week of the missed recitation and discuss whatever it was that they missed (time permitting), then get a verbal assessment. 

* **Receive more serious accommodations**: I will work with students personally who have things that are more than a week late. I am happy to make accommodations for students who have serious things going on, but we need to have a separate
process for handling them. Last semester I had a number of students abuse our informal process for making accommodations; I want to make this more formal this year.


### A word on coaches, for the TA's

You'll have some undergraduate coaches in your recitation section as well. These folks are people who have taken PHY211 in the past and are now working as part of the teaching team. In my experience the coaches are often the best instructors we have -- better than I am, and better than you are -- because they were so recently students themselves and remember what it's like to learn this stuff for the first time. They will mostly do the same things you will do -- talk to students, respond to raised hands, and answer students' questions. 

However, even though the coaches will often be better instructors than we are, we generally know more physics than they do. Part of your job is to serve as an "expert in the room"; if the coaches are presenting things to students in a way that is confusing or incorrect, you will have the background needed to clarify things. Generally the coaches are excellent, but if you encounter a situation where a coach is regularly unprepared or making mistakes, please let me know so I can steer things back on course.

## Weekly Staff Meetings

We'll schedule two staff meetings on Monday and Tuesday at times that accommodate everyone. You will need to come to one or the other each week. During those meetings, we'll discuss how things have gone in the previous week and what we're teaching them in class. We'll have a series of coaches work through the exercises for the upcoming week, and discuss what aspects of the exercises the students will likely find challenging, what we're trying to teach them, and how to help them. 

This also serves as good practice for everyone, especially in the situation where a coach makes a mistake. In that event, respond to them like you would one of the students: don't just tell them the answer, but ask them leading questions to help their understanding. Remember: we are all here to support each other, and errors do not mean a lack of skill or qualification to teach.

### Homework

Homework in this class is purely traditional (i.e. long-answer questions). They will submit homework on Blackboard. 

In each homework set, you will grade two problems out of ten points and examine the solution for correctness, using the following rubric:

* 10: solution correct and well-explained
* 8-9: solution mostly correct, but minor flaws in the solution or its explanation that do not reflect a deficiency in physics knowledge
* 7-8: solution reflects physical insight and a basic understanding of the principles, but with errors that *do* reflect a flaw in physics knowledge
* 5-6: solution partially correct, but with significant deficits that prevent the student from completing the problem, or significant omissions
* less than 5: some work that indicates knowledge, but not significant progress to a solution

Keep in mind that in this class, the breakpoints between A/B/C/D/F are 80/65/55/50.

You should deduct points for things that are not well-explained, and should deduct significant credit for solutions that have numbers substituted in for variables too early (so they consist of lines of arithmetic that makes little narrative sense rather than algebra that shows what the student is doing and thinking), even if the final answer is correct.

**Important:** Many parts of questions will ask students to explain things in words rather than symbols. *Do not gloss over these*. If a student's explanation is fragmented, weak, or incoherent, *please* deduct significant credit 
for the entire problem -- especially early in the semester. Many students underestimate the necessity of communicating clearly about physics in words, not just in mathematics; these students often find themselves unable to do the
mathematics either because they do not develop physical reasoning skills. Deduct significant credit and tell them why.

You will grade the remaining problems out of two points. This shouldn't take you long; you are basically looking to see if the student made an honest attempt at the problem. Use the following rubric:

* 2: a solution which could be correct
* 1: a partial solution or a good start on the problem
* 0: Nothing, or nothing substantive

#### Maintaining Gradebooks

In the first two weeks of class, we'll create a separate "Smart View" of each TA's students on Blackboard. You are responsible for grading your students' homework and in-class exams, and for keeping up with their recitation assessments. 
If a student has a question or complaint about their grade, you have authority to change their grades within reason (but not for recitation work more than a week late!) If there is a clear error in a student's exam grade, you can fix it.

Every week, we will ask you for an update on your grading. If you are a bit behind on grading, that is not a big deal. But if you are falling seriously behind, _ask for help_. 

If a student wants to *appeal* their exam grade, then you can either hear their appeal (but not during recitation when other students need you!) or send them to me. However, if they are appealing something other than an arithmetic error, you can ask them to work the problem out for you without notes, live. 
Their grade should be based solely on what they wrote down during the exam, but per the class policy in order to hear *any* appeal, they first need to demonstrate that they know what a correct solution is!

### Exams

We will have five midterm mini-exams and a final.

We'll need a few proctors on those days in class to answer student questions (who may be TA's or coaches). During the final we'll need everyone or nearly everyone to help proctor. 

### Paper Grading

We will be discussing the process of science in our class, and students will write a paper on pseudoscience/science denialism later in the term. You'll be responsible for grading these papers. We'll talk about this more as the time comes, but this is coming sometime in April and will be a fair bit of work.
