My purpose is to set forth a very new science dealing with a very ancient subject.
There is, in nature, perhaps nothing older than motion,
concerning which the books written by philosophers are neither few nor small
nevertheless I have discovered by experiment some properties of it which are worth
knowing and which have not hitherto been either observed or demonstrated....

\bigskip

So far as I know, no one has yet pointed out that the distances traversed, during equal intervals of time, by a body falling from rest,
stand to one another {\bf in the same ratio as the odd numbers beginning with unity.}

Slack is basically Discord for professionals. It's a more efficient way than email for you all to ask for help
and discuss our class.

\BS

There's a link on the course website to join (and clients for Linux, Windows, macOS, iThings, Android...)

\BS\BS

Please make sure you use the different channels for what they're designed for:

\BI
\item Memes and so forth go in \#random
\item Discussions of homework go in \#homework1, \#homework2, etc.
\item To join a channel (like a Discord room), you can type ``/join \#homework1'' or click on ``channels'' on the left
\item If you have a question that other people may care about too, post it in a public channel and tag me (@Walter Freeman), rather than PM'ing me
\EI

\BS\pause

Please be decent to each other: I already had to banhammer someone for making an account impersonating an instructor (if that was you, just make another account).

Complete description of motion: ``Where is my object at each point in time?''

\bigskip

This corresponds to a mathematical function. Two ways to represent these. Suppose I drop
a ball off a building, putting the origin at the ground and calling ``up'' the positive direction:

\column{0.5\textwidth}
\centerline{\color{Blue} \large $\rightarrow$ ... when $y(t)=0$}
\end{columns}

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Velocity: how fast position changes}}
The slope of the position vs. time curve has a special significance. Here's one with a constant slope:

\medskip

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{constant-v-crop.pdf}}

\bigskip

\pause

Slope is $\frac{{\rm rise}}{{\rm run}}$ = $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$ = $\frac{2\,\rm m}{1 \, \rm s}$ = 2 meters per second (positive;
it could well be negative!)

\bigskip \pause

{\color{Red} $\rightarrow$ The slope here -- change in position over change in time -- is the {\bf velocity}!} \\Note that it can be
positive or negative, depending on which way the object moves.

}


\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Constant-$v$ motion: connecting graphs to algebra}}
If an object moves with constant velocity, its position vs. time graph is a line:

\medskip

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{constant-v-2-crop.pdf}}

We know the equation of a straight line is is $x = mt + b$ (using $t$ and $x$ as our axes).

\BI
\item{$m$ is the slope, which we identified as the velocity}
\item{$b$ is the vertical intercept, which we recognize as the value of $x$ when $t=0$}
\EI

We can thus change the variable names to be more descriptive:

\bigskip

\centerline{\Large{{\color{Red} $x(t) = vt + x_0$} (constant-velocity motion)}}

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Going from ``equations of motion'' to answers}}

\large

{\color{Red}$x(t) = vt + x_0$} is called an {\it equation of motion}; in this case, it is valid for constant-velocity motion.

\medskip

It gives you the same information as a position vs. time graph, but in algebraic form.

\bigskip
\bigskip

\normalsize

To solve real problems, we need to be able to translate physical questions into algebraic statements:

\pause
\BI
\item{Using $x(t) = x_0 + vt$, with $x_0=30\, {\rm mi}$ and $v = 50 \frac{\rm mi}{\rm hr}$, calculate $x$ at $t=1\, {\rm hr}$}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Asking the right questions}}
\large
``I drop an object from a height $h$. When does it hit the ground?'' How do I
do this? (Take $x_0=h$ and upward to be positive.)

\BS
\large
Remember, we want to ask a question in terms of our physical variables. This question 
has the form:

\item Put that value of $t$ back into $x_1(t)$ or $x_2(t)$ to answer your question!

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Kinematics: how does acceleration affect movement?}}
\large
Newton's law ${\color{A}a} = {\color{B}F}/{\color{C}m}$ tells us that {\it acceleration} -- the second derivative of position -- is what results from forces. 

\BS\large

All objects on Earth experience a downward force from Earth's gravity:

\BC {\color{B} (Force from gravity)} = {\color{C} (mass of object)} $\times$ {\color{D}(strength of Earth's gravity)} \EC

In symbols:

$${\color{B}F_g} = \color{C} m\color{D}g$$

Substituting this force into Newton's second law we get:

$${\color{A}a} = {\color{B}F_g} / {\color{C}m} = \color{C} m\color{D}g / \color{C} m$$

\bigskip\pause
\BC
This tells us that {\color{Red}all freely falling objects have a constant acceleration downward.}

The value of $g$ near Earth's surface is about $9.8 \mss$.

\EI
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{A warning for people who took high school physics!}}

\large
The value of the Earth's gravitational acceleration is ``$9.8\mss$ directed downward''. 

\BS

The constant $g$ simply refers to the {\it size} of this: $g \equiv 9.8\mss$.

\BS

Whether ``down'' is positive or negative depends on your choice of coordinate system. 

\BS

If you choose ``up'' to be positive, then you might write for a falling object ``$x(t)=-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$'', but $g$ 
itself {\it always represents a positive value}.
