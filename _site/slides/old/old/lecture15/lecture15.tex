\item{It represents the cumulative effect of a force over time, much as work gives the cumulative effect of a force over distance}
\item{``Forces make things accelerate'' $\rightarrow$ ``A force applied over time makes something change velocity''}
\item{If the force is constant, then the integral is easy, and $\vec J = \vec F t$}

    ... the ``baseball/bat'' problem on Practice Exam 2!

    \bigskip

\normalsize
A baseball is pitched toward a batter. The batter hits it, knocking the ball back over the
pitcherâ€™s head. Just before the batter hits it, it is traveling at 40 m/s parallel to the ground.
After the batter hits it, it is traveling at 60 m/s at an angle 30 degrees above the horizontal.
The bat is in contact with the ball for 10 milliseconds; assume that the bat exerts a constant
force on the ball during this time. If the ball has a mass of 145 grams, what is the size of
this force, and in what direction does it point?

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Conservation of momentum}}
    \BI
  \item{Newton's third law: if $A$ pushes on $B$, $B$ pushes back on $A$ with an equal and opposite force}
  \item{In symbols, $\vec F_{AB} = -\vec F_{BA}$}
  \item{We can integrate both sides of this to get a statement about impulse: $\vec J_{AB} = -\vec J_{BA}$}
  \item{Using the impulse-momentum theorem: $\Delta \vec p_A = -\Delta \vec p_B \rightarrow \Delta (\vec p_A + \vec p_A) = 0$}
  \item{\color{Red}The total change in momentum is zero!}
  \item{The force between $A$ and $B$ leaves the total momentum constant; it just gets transferred from one to the other}
  \item{{\bf Remember momentum is a vector!}}
  \item{As with conservation of energy, need ``before'' and ``after'' snapshots}
  \item{Just add up the momentum before and after and set it equal!}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Collisions and explosions}}
  Often things collide or explode; we need to be able to understand this.
  \BI
\item{Very complicated forces between pieces often involved: can't track them all}
\item{These forces are huge but short-lived, delivering their impulse very quickly}
\item{Other forces usually small enough to not matter during the collision/explosion}
\item{Use conservation of momentum to understand the collision}
\item{If we know nothing else, we often don't have enough equations to solve for our unknowns...}
\item{One dimension: one equation, often two unknowns}
  \BI
\item{$m_1 v_{1,i} + m_2 v_{2,i} = m_1 v_{1,f} + m_2 v_{2,f}$}
  \EI
  \pause
\item{Two dimensions: two equations, often four unknowns}
\BI
\item{$m_1 v_{1,x,i} + m_2 v_{2,x,i} = m_1 v_{1,x,f} + m_2 v_{2,x,f}$}
\item{$m_1 v_{1,y,i} + m_2 v_{2,y,i} = m_1 v_{1,y,f} + m_2 v_{2,y,f}$}
\EI
\pause
\item{Often things stick together (``perfectly inelastic collision''): $\vec v_{1,f} = \vec v_{2,f}$}
\item{This reduces the number of unknowns to one (1D) or two (2D)}

  Two train cars moving toward each other at 5 m/s collide and couple together. One weighs 10 tons; the other weighs 20 tons. What is their final velocity?
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Sample problems: a 1D collision}}
  \Large
  A train car with a mass $m$ is at rest on a track. Another train car also of mass $m$ is moving toward it with a velocity $v_0$ when it is a distance $d$ away. 
  The first car hits the second and couples to it; the cars roll together until friction brings them to a stop.

\bigskip


If the coefficient of rolling friction is $\mu_r$, how far do they roll after the collision?

Method: use conservation of momentum to understand the collision; use other methods to understand before and after!
