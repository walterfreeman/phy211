### Study material for Exam 3

<a href="AJ-comprehensive-notes.pdf">Comprehensive notes for 2021's PHY211 course</a>, by our coach Juanitta "AJ" Bekoe

* *Note of caution -- AJ provided this for folks' use, but this is an -enormous- volume of info. These are her notes and study guide, written
by her to document the way that things make sense to her, organized by her for her use. You will likely have a 
different way of "explaining stuff to yourself"; please use her notes as a reference if you need to look up something specific,
or as a guide to which of our problems will help you study different ideas, but reading someone else's understanding of things
is no substitute for constructing your own understanding for yourself. Note also that the units last year were a bit different
than this year, so don't be thrown off.

Also -- AJ's notes are the most organized notes I have ever seen for any class ever. If you see her and find this useful, thank her!*

AJ also suggests looking at these bits of the recitation solution videos to see Sydney's discussion of the problems we looked at
in the review tonight.
