This calendar is tentative and will likely change as the semester progresses. Exam dates will not change without overwhelming consensus, but topics might be adjusted if the calendar changes.

Note that the textbook does not track our presentation exactly; I've chosen the order of topics to simplify things for you, but that makes it a bit tougher to follow along in the book.
