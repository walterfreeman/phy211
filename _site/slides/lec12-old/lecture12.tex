\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Announcements}}
	\Large
	Help hours today: I'll be in the Physics Clinic 10:00-10:45 and 4-6.
\bigskip

Other people will be there to assist you during the rest of the day.

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Group Exam 2}}
	\large
	
	Your second group exam is Wednesday.
	
	\BS
	
	I know it is a short turnaround before the exam on Thursday.
	
	\BS
	
	So, I will be posting full solutions during the day, as soon as each group finishes their exam.
	
	\BS
	
	That way, as soon as the last group finishes, you'll have the full solutions.
}

	
	\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Exam 2}}

	
	This exam will be just like Exam 1. A few reminders:
	
	\BI
	\item You may bring a page of notes
	\item You may bring a calculator (not one that does algebra)
	\item There will be assigned seats (different than before)
	\item Taking your exam at CDR? They'll have a copy for you. 
	\item Need other accommodations? Let me know.
	\EI
	
	\BS\BS
	
	What will be on it? 
	{\color{Red} \bf Relating the forces on objects to their motion with $\vec F = m \vec a$:}
	
	\BI
	\item Drawing force diagrams
	\item Dealing with inclines 
	\item Dealing with multiple objects
	\item Dealing with unknown tension/normal forces
	\item Dealing with friction
	\item Dealing with circular motion
	\item Interpreting things like ``why doesn't the frog fall out of the bucket?''
	\EI
}	

\frame{

	
	{\bf Drawing force diagrams:}
	
	\BI
	\item Each object gets its own force diagram
	\item Only forces acting {\it directly on that object} go on the diagram
	\item Let physics take care of indirect things for you (three book problem)
	\item Forces are real tangible things (plus gravity)
	\item Label each force with the symbol you'll use for it in algebra
	\item Draw your diagrams {\bf large} -- you may need to do trig, etc.
	\EI
	
	\BS\BS
	
	{\bf Dealing with inclines:}
	
	
	\BI
	\item Tilt your coordinate system so it aligns with the (possible) acceleration
	\item $a_y$ will generally be zero
	\item You'll need to decompose the weight force into components
	\EI
	
	\BS\BS
	
	{\bf Dealing with multiple objects:}
	
	\BI
	\item Each object gets its own force diagram
	\item Only draw the forces acting on each object on its diagram
	\item Different objects may have different $\vec a$:
	\BI
	\item Use $a_{1,x}$, $a_{2,y}$, etc. -- then think how they relate
	\item You'll have multiple equations -- that's okay
	\EI	\EI
	
}

\frame{
	
	
	{\bf Dealing with unknown tension/normal forces:}
	
	\BI
	\item Just because they're unknown doesn't make them scary
	\item Normal forces are however big they need to be to stop two objects from moving through one another
	\item Tension is however big it needs to be to keep ropes from stretching
	\item Leave $F_N$ or $T$ as unknowns in your system of equations -- you'll solve for them
	\EI
	
	\BS\BS
	
	{\bf Dealing with inclines:}
	
	
	\BI
	\item Tilt your coordinate system so it aligns with the (possible) acceleration
	\item $a_y$ will generally be zero
	\item You'll need to decompose the weight force into components
	\EI
	
	\BS\BS
	
	{\bf Dealing with friction:}
	
\BI
\item Friction opposes the relative motion of two things
\item For passive objects this is simple
\item ``Traction'' -- static friction between propelled vehicle/person/animal and ground
\BI
\item It points whatever direction the driver wants it to
\EI
\item Friction requires you to deal with two dimensions -- first find $F_N$, then substitute into $F_{\rm fric} = \mu F_N$
\EI
	
}
\frame{
	
	
	{\bf Dealing with circular motion:}
	
	\BI
	\item If an object is going in a circle, that just tells you its acceleration
	\item $a = \omega^2 r$ or $v^2/r$ toward the center
	\item Use the first one if you know/care about $\omega$ and the second if you know/care about $v$
	\item {\color{Green} Do not overcomplicate this!}
	\EI
	
	\BS\BS
	
	{\bf Interpreting motion in an accelerating frame:}
	
	
	\BI
	\item Newton's laws are {\it not valid} in an accelerating ``box''
	\BI
	\item Accelerating/turning car
	\item A room rotating in a circle
	\EI
	\item Think about what it looks like from the {\it outside}
	\item Bus slams on brakes $\rightarrow$ bus accelerates backwards, passengers don't
	\item Car turns left $\rightarrow$ car accelerates left, passengers keep going straight 
	\item Bucket accelerates toward center of circle $\rightarrow$ bucket must push on frog to make it accelerate with it
	\EI
	
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Two sample problems}}
	
	\Large
	
	I'm going to give you two problems, one at a time, to do.
	
	\BS\BS
	
	These are similar to exam problems. I want you to work them out, in full, on your own paper. Then I'll do them.
	
	\BS\BS
	
	Raise your hand if you have questions, and I'll come up to your seat.
	
	\BS\BS
	
	We'll spend the rest of class on this.
