### Week 1 checkin

You can find the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1geZRFwHwJrK4j3fX8iTzZu2NFuB97ScAEdeSsDvg3Vg/">week 1 checkin</a> here. Tell us a little about yourself and how it's going; this should take just a few minutes, and is due Monday at noon.

### Where do I find...

* Looking for the slides we use in class? All the past slides are linked from the calendar page.
* Looking for the homework assignments, recitation materials, etc? They've got separate pages; if you're on mobile, you can find them in the "hamburger menu".
* Looking for the Physics Clinic to get help with your homework? It's room 112 on the opposite side of the Physics Building from our auditorium.

### Slides for current class

### Upcoming assignments

* <a href="hw/hw1/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a> is due next Friday. (I decided to make it due Friday after all so you have more time.)

* Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/bngYwjZRHk">course Discord server</a> if you are so inclined
