    <h1 class="post-title">Questions</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Here are the <a href="w1q.html">previous week’s questions</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Something about astrophysics! Maybe your favorite fun fact or something like that, I don’t have a specific question at the moment.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>There are holes in the rainbow and they tell us that we are all made of stardust.</em></p>

<p><em>Is the homework always this long?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re usually 7-8 questions. We anticipate that an average homework set (which you’ll have a week and a half to do) will take you 4-6 hours to complete outside class; some might be more, some might be less.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Even if you think you understand physics what is a good mindset to have going about this course and to even higher level physics?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Physics is, more than anything else, a perspective and a language: it’s how we look at and how we describe Nature. It is at once both humbling and empowering: humbling in that there are things that even the greatest minds overlook (this is why an 80% is an A in our class!), and empowering in the astonishing scope of the things that we can understand and accomplish.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How long have you been growing out your hair?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Maybe six years? I don’t know. I don’t really take care of it (people keep telling me about a thing called “conditioner” but I don’t know what that is). The people in the 8am section will likely see me come into class with icicles in my hair one of these days.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How is radioactive waste from nukes cleaned up?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>With extreme difficulty. Small amounts of radioisotopes can have significant health impacts. After an incident like the Chernobyl explosion that released radioactivity into the atmosphere, people collected and buried topsoil that was contaminated. However, even a large incident like Chernobyl or Fukushima doesn’t result in that much harm to human health. For comparison, the Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns will likely result in about a hundred deaths from cancer; the tsunami killed two hundred times as many people. Fossil fuel sources of electricity (coal and gas) result in far more harm to health – and that’s not counting climate change.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Will significant figures be required in answers at some point during the semester?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Nope!</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is there a way that we can view past week’s slides after the next weeks are posted? Like is there a section on the Physics webpage where we can see all the slides we covered as opposed to only the what we’re covering in that specific week.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re on the calendar page on the website.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is it possible to build a Quantum computer that will allow one to go back in time?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Nope. Quantum computers just process information; they don’t manipulate time and space.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can you please do some more example problems during class?</em><br />
<em>Is there any way we could do more practice questions during lecture?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Yep! That’s what we’re doing all this week.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This might be a silly question, but is there a way we can access the recitation work packet answers online after class to verify and review our answers?</em><br />
<em>Can you post video examples of certain problems because I am more of a visual learner</em><br />
<em>Will the answers for the recitation packets be posted at all?</em><br />
<em>Can there be recitation packet keys? I really would want that for test review</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>One of our coaches, Sydney Jud, made some solution videos for the recitations. I’m posting them tonight.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is physics 2 a continuation of this course?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>It is the application of the things you learn in this class to electricity and magnetism, along with some new mathematics you’ll need to apply them.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Are there outside sources I can use to better understand the material?</em><br />
<em>what are the best extracurricular resources to learn Physics?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>I’m sure there are – lots of people teach physics, and I don’t have any particular things on the internet to recommend. The best sources are the living humans that teach our class – come ask questions in the Clinic or Discord as you have them.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Making the position, velocity, position graphs. Using one to make the other (position —&gt; velocity)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask me about the bicycle problem (homework) or the rocket problem (recitation) in class sometime if you want to review this.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I go to physics center for homework help</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Of course – that’s what it’s for!</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I wasn’t able to go to recitation on Friday because of snow and because of work and other classes, groups outside of class would be hard to go to. Would we be able to go over HW1 Q4 in class?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Sure! Ask me in class.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Will there be more in-class demonstrations?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Lots and lots of them. I’ll probably fall off of something at some point and it will be hilarious!</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why did we have to use the quadratic equation in the 5th problem. To me it seemed like there was no reason for it.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>What’s your alternative solution?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How can I prepare for the exam?</em><br />
<em>What is the best way to prepare for the upcoming exam?</em><br />
<em>How many problems will be on the test?</em><br />
<em>How many questions is on the 1st exam? How many points is on the exam? What’s the best way to prepare for the 1st exam? Is understanding the homework and recitation problems enough to prepare?</em>
How many questions on average are on the exam? Are any of them multiple choice?<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Four questions, all free response/long answer, with multiple parts for partial credit. Understanding the things from homework and recitation is an excellent way to prepare. (Note that HW1 #6, the analytic integration one, will NOT be like anything on the exam.)</li>
  <li>To prepare, make sure you understand the recitation and homework problems fully; work on the practice exam (posted Friday); discuss these things in groups. Go out with your friends in the class and talk through how you approached everything.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“Why was the calc 2 question included in the homework? Especially since people who are currently taking calc 1 being penalized for not knowing how to solve it when it was stated that we could still succeed in the class without elaborate calc skills.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>This question isn’t one of the ones graded “for credit”; it’s something of “bonus content” for the people who are in calc 2. This is the only time anything like this will show up this semester, so don’t worry!</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Are the homework and recitation questions harder questions that will be on the exam? And, why do you choose to provide “harder” questions on the homework/recitation packets instead of gradually increasing difficulty? What are the educational benefits of that?”</em><br />
<em>Are exams similar to homework problems? If yes, then are there opportunities for more practice?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The exam questions will be about the same difficulty as the easier questions from the homework. For examples of things that are a similar difficulty to what you will see on the exam – HW1 #4 and $5, and the “cannon” and “dog” (and perhaps the “hiker”) problems from HW2. I give you more difficult things to do on the homework and recitations because I want to stretch you and give you all the opportunities to learn that I can. The goal of the homework isn’t only to prepare you for the exams, although it will do that; it’s to give you an avenue to learn.</li>
  <li>For more practice, see the recitation exercises and the practice exam on Friday.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>It’s not really for the course but I don’t really understand vectors that much and would very much like to go over it again in lecture. I want to understand what they actually represent and how I can use them while going over a problem that I have to solve for it.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>We’ll do that this week! Ask me if you want me to review anything in particular.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What is the best way to practice/ try to understand the material from class (besides homework’s)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask lots of questions in recitation, and in the Physics Clinic and on Discord while working on the homework. Remember, physics is a language and a perspective, not just a set of facts that you learn on your own.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can you stay on each slide a bit longer? I can’t write the notes fast enough although that may just be me</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>You don’t need to write everything down; remember the slides are all posted. Write down your thoughts, instead. But you can always ask! Also, starting this week we will slow down.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Number 7 HW1.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ll do this in class tomorrow if you want.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I heard that the grades in this course are curved. Could you explain this in more detail, please.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>80-100 A, 65-80 B, 55-65 C, 50-55 D.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can we do more problems in lecture? In recitation I feel like we are being thrown in with not much warning about what we are learning, and I feel like I spend all of my time in recitation learning other than practicing what I have already learned.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, we’re going to do more examples in lecture. However, in recitation, you say that you are “learning” rather than “practicing” – practicing <em>is</em> learning. Lecture is only so that you are familiar with the ideas; recitation is where you really learn. You are not supposed to be able to instantly do all the recitation exercises; they should involve some difficulty and “grunt” on your part.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has the average grade been for the first exam in previous years?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Usually a B.</em></p>

<p><em>What is your favorite unit in physics to teach?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Computational physics and numerical methods! I want to reform this course next year to put a lot of Python programming in it (and less pencil-and-paper math).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>In general, is there more credit awarded to things like documentation of thought, units, and work shown, than to correct answers?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes. If you know what you are doing but make a mistake, we will give you most (almost all) of the credit. This is why we don’t do computer-graded homework or multiple choice.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Will the homeworks all be around the same length?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ones you have a week to do will be a little shorter than the week-and-a-half ones. Homework 2 is probably the most “dense” (amount of work divided by time to do it in).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Will we need to be able to do integrals and derivatives?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Not analytically, although you will need to relate position/velocity/acceleration curves like we’ve done. (The “bicycle problem” and the “rocket problem” from HW1 and Recitation Week 2 Wednesday respectively)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How does the notes sheet for the exam work again? Can I print out handwritten notes that I’ve saved as pdf’s? I use a reusable notebook so I can scan my handwritten notes into pdf’s in folders online, and was wondering if those would count as handwritten notes/be acceptable to bring to the exam. (I sent you an email with this question, asking here again in case you didn’t see it.)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>I didn’t get that email actually. Check that you sent it to the right address. But yes – if it is your handwriting, you can do that, so long as it is one page and is your handwriting with a stylus.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>My lab got cancelled due to snow on Thursday, can you just clarify in class on how/when I need to make that up?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Check the PHY221 syllabus. I don’t teach that class so I don’t know.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Are there practice quizzes with answers available for practice?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>There will be one Friday and you’ll get the answers Sunday after you’ve had a chance to do it on your own.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This has nothing to do with physics but I want to know how to make a github website</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Come see me in the Clinic sometime and I’ll show you. :)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is it OK that I submit this after Monday noon (about 5 hours late) and get full points?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Sure. :)</li>
</ul>
