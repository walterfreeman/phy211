My availability in the Physics Clinic is a bit limited this week because of other commitments.

\bigskip

You can find me in the Clinic:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Today (Tuesday), 1:30-3:30 pm
	\item Today (Tuesday), 5:15-6:15 (if possible)
	\item Wednesday, 2-4 pm
	\item Thursday, 9:45-10:30 am
\end{itemize}

Many of you asked for evening help hours. I am working to get coaches available for this and I'll let you know their availability by mail tonight.

\it
Rational mechanics must be the science of the motions which result from any forces, and of the forces which are required for any motions, accurately propounded and demonstrated. For many things induce me to suspect, that all natural phenomena may depend upon some forces by which the particles of bodies are either drawn towards each other, and cohere, or repel and recede from each other: and these forces being hitherto unknown, philosophers have pursued their researches in vain. And I hope that the principles expounded in this work will afford some light, either to this mode of philosophizing, or to some mode which is more true.

Mechanics involves figuring out how things move from knowing the forces that act on them, and figuring out what forces act on them
if we know how they move. I suspect that all physical things involve things exerting forces on each other, and since we don't know
what forces these are, nobody's been able to figure much out. Hopefully someone will read this book and figure this stuff out, either
following my suspicion that it's all forces under the hood ({\rm \bf classical physics!}), or with some deeper understanding of nature
({\rm \bf quantum physics!})
