See the "Week 1 questions" link for answers to all the questions you asked me in the check-in.

### Where do I find...

* Looking for the slides we use in class? All the past slides are linked from the calendar page.
* Looking for the homework assignments, recitation materials, etc? They've got separate pages; if you're on mobile, you can find them in the "hamburger menu".
* Looking for the Physics Clinic to get help with your homework? It's room 112 on the opposite side of the Physics Building from our auditorium.
