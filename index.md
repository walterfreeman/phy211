### The Virtual Physics Clinic

The Physics Clinic has gone virtual on Zoom. Here is the <a href="clinic-description.pdf">general description</a> of how it will
work, and a <a href="clinic-faq">Virtual Clinic FAQ</a> with answers to some common questions.

The part of the Virtual Clinic run by the Physics Department will run from 1-7 PM Syracuse time Monday through Thursday, and 1-5 PM Syracuse time on Friday. 

However, PHY211 will have additional help hours as well to accommodate people's schedules and time zones. If you would like us to meet with you at a 
specific time, tell us, and we'll get you help at that time!

You can join the Virtual Clinic at <a href="https://zoom.us/j/668912935">https://zoom.us/j/668912935</a>. If you don't have Zoom
already, you may be prompted to download a small program.
