\centerline{\sc{Due Friday, 14 April}}

The main part of HW8 is to redo Exam 3 and to answer a few questions about it. There are a few more questions on the next page.

You may either print the exam from the course website or use the one you got in recitation last Friday and write on it. Anyone who earned 80\% or better on each question here is exempt from repeating it. (You can just write ``exempt'' on the question on the exam you turn in.) If you would like me to print it for you, I will have some available in the Physics Clinic starting Monday midday.

Two notes:

{\bf Grading standards:} Your work must clearly show that you know what you are doing. We will not be scrounging around for ``ways to give you a bit of partial credit''. If it is not clear that you know what you are 

{\bf Academic integrity:} Since this assignment can earn you some credit back on Exam 3, the seriousness of our academic integrity standards are the same as they would be on an exam. However, this is not an exam, and you are encouraged to collaborate with others and seek help in understanding things. 

Just as on other homework, you may:

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss the questions with any people you like, and ask them for help understanding the physics
\item Collaborate with your classmates or anyone else in understanding the material
\end{itemize}

Just as on other homework, you may not:

\begin{itemize}
\item Post the exam questions or solutions to Chegg or any other commercial website or other platform that facilitates academic dishonesty, or copy solutions from them 
\item Submit any work that you do not fully understand or cannot explain
\item Submit any work that is the result of copying from somewhere else rather than the authentic result of your own effort
\end{itemize}

%There are two other exercises I'd like you to do; they are in this document.
%
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item   A castle's drawbridge consists of a heavy wooden plank that can be opened or closed using a rope, as shown below:
%	
%	\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
%		The rope is attached to the door 4/5 of the way down its length; the left side of the plank is attached to a hinge
%		in the ground.
%		The bridge is left in a partially-raised state by a careless sentry. It makes an angle of $30^\circ$ with the horizontal; the rope that supports it is perpendicular to the
%		bridge.
%	\end{minipage}
%	\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
%		\begin{center}
%			\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{door-crop.pdf}
%		\end{center}
%		
%	\end{minipage}
%	\medskip
%	
%	If the mass of the door is $m$, calculate the tension $T$ in the rope in terms of $\theta$, $m$, and $g$.

	\textit{(This is an old exam problem.)} A meter stick is elevated at a $\theta=30^\circ$ angle. A spool consists of a cylinder of radius 2 cm with two disks affixed on either end; the disks have a 
	radius of 10 cm. The cylinder is very light; you may assume all of the mass of the spool is in the disks. The spool is placed at the top of the meter stick
	so that the cylinder is touching the stick; when it is released, it rolls without slipping to the bottom. \it (The moment of inertia of a disk is $\frac{1}{2}mr^2)$. \rm
	
	In this problem, you will calculate the speed of the spool at the bottom. 
	
	\small
	
	{\bf Rules for this problem:} You may solve this problem in either symbols or numbers. 
	If you use symbols, you must tell me the physical values of each symbol that you use (for instance: ``$r=2$ cm''). If you use numbers, you {\it must} retain the
	units (i.e. write ``10 cm'', not ``10''.)

	\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
		\BC
		\it (Side view)
		
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{sideview-crop.pdf}
		\EC
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
		\BC
		\it (Rear view)
		
		\vspace{1cm}
		
		\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{rearview-crop.pdf}
		\EC
	\end{minipage}
	

	
	a) What is the relation between the spool's translational velocity $v$ and its angular velocity $\omega$? 
	

	b) Construct an equation showing the conservation of energy as the spool rolls down the slope. What sorts of energy does it have at the top? What about the bottom?
	
	c) Calculate the velocity of the spool at the bottom. Remember, if you use variables, you must tell me what number each symbol represents!
