Here you can find video links to all of the solution videos, lecture recordings, and the like on the Physics 211 YouTube channel.

This material will also be posted to Blackboard soon, as soon as I discover what format it needs to be in.

If you would like it uploaded to Tencent Video or any other video sharing site, please let me know. (Note that I'll have to get someone to help me
upload to Tencent Video since I do not speak Chinese.)

Also, if there is a request, I can livestream these videos on the SU Physics Twitch channel as I am producing them. Please let me (Walter) know if you want me to do that.

The recitation solutions for March 11 and 13 are messier than future ones will be; it turns out I needed to calibrate my stylus. My apologies; I am new to using a tablet.
