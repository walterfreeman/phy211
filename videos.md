Here you can find links to slides and video recordings of our class.

**NOTE:** These slides are often not what we use in class. As you know, we generally present things on the chalkboard, rather than only on slides. These slides typically contain examples that we did in previous years;
I often improvise different examples this year based on your feedback and input during class. The material is the same, but the examples may differ. (There are also "clicker questions" here that we do not do this year,
since now you can type longer answers to me rather than just holding up A/B/C/D cards.)

Still, these slides may serve as useful references for you.
