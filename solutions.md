### Recitation solutions

Our coach Sydney Jud has been making video solutions to recitation problems on her YouTube channel "Sydney Explains Stuff".

A link to her YouTube channel with all of her videos is at <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRI8Qa_rVT3aRal4vP4acNQ>; there you can find links for all 
of the recitations with her explanations. Thanks so much to Sydney for making these!
