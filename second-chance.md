Here are the "exam second chance" exercises, along with copies of past exams and practice exams
that they reference.

These are optional. If you choose to do them, then you may do up to three for an extra homework grade.
(That grade will only increase your overall grade; it cannot decrease it.)

We suggest that you do the three corresponding to your lowest three exam questions, since those 
are the topics that you will see again on the day of the final. You can see what your lowest three
exam questions are by looking at the exams you have gotten back or on Blackboard.

We are scheduling specific study sessions to help you with these. The times are listed below.

More will be added
to this schedule as I get more information about the availability of instructors who will teach them. 
(We are doing mostly the Exam 3 ones this first week since it is your homework.)
