Here you can find video links to all of the solution videos, lecture recordings, and the like on the Physics 211 YouTube channel.

These are also posted on Blackboard, and will soon be posted on Bilibili.

Also, if there is a request, I can livestream these videos on the SU Physics Twitch channel and/or on Collaborate as I am producing them. Please let me (Walter) know if you want me to do that. I can respond to questions in realtime asked over chat that way.

The recitation solutions for March 11 and 13 are messier than future ones will be; it turns out I needed to calibrate my stylus. My apologies; I am new to using a tablet.
