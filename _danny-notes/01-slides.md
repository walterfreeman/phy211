3. Developing lifelong learning skills

</section>

<section data-markdown>

All three of these goals are clearly important. However,  which of these three goals do you think you can do on our own (say, before class)?

1. Acquiring information (facts, principles, concepts, procedures)
2. Learning how to use information and knowledge in new situations
3. Developing lifelong learning skills

## What do you think PHY 481 is about?

</section>

<section data-markdown>

### Electromagnetism is the foundational field theory of physics

Think about everything you already know about electromagnetism (it's a lot already!).

Work with a partner to map out the electromagnetism concepts that you know and how they are related to each other.
