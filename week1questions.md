* How many questions will typically be on a test?
* How long are the exams on average (in terms of question count)?
* Are the questions done in recitations/in class similar to those on exams? "
* Do tests resemble homework/ recitation work?

*They're usually four questions. And yes -- the questions on the exams will test the same skills you have learned in recitation and homework. The homework 
questions are harder than the exam questions (since you have lots of time and are expected to collaborate and ask questions on the homework).*

* How many exams do we have over the semester?

*Three midterms and a final.*

* What would you say is the most difficult unit of this course? Like which topic would you say students in the past have generally struggled to the most with? 

*In general, the material on torque and rotation is the most difficult. This is why we put it at the end. :)*

* Are we really not doing any hard math or are you just saying that so the su students don’t get scared? (because to be honest, i was a bit disappointed LOL)

*We're really not doing any hard math. :) That doesn't mean that we're not doing any substantive physics, though. The challenge physics generally comes in 
reasoning clearly and carefully, not in the difficulty of the mathematics; we'll find that simple mathematics still lets us understand profound things.*

*Let me make an analogy. Mathematics is the language that physics is written in, right?
Sometimes in language we use subtle and complex grammar or unusual words, and authors have made excellent use of complicated grammar and lofty language in telling 
their stories: Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and many others. But you can write beautiful poetry using simple language, and tell a profound story using plain
grammar and diction. In our class we'll be emphasizing the stories we tell, not the language we use to tell them. Sometimes we'll need some fancy mathematical
ideas, but only rarely. Shakespeare used such language when he needed to, but Shakespeare's plays are full of fart jokes and crude anatomical references, too.
Physcs aims to be the Shakespeare of the sciences, telling profound stories about existence,
using fancy language only when we need to, and getting in as many good laughs (and discussions of the physics of farts) 
along the way as we can.*


* What qualities do you look for when you’re looking for the Coaches for recitations? 

*People who work well with others, support their peers, and show a knack not just for understanding physics but* **understanding how we understand physics**. *This last is called "metacognition", and it's the 
greatest attribute of a good tutor. We recruit coaches from recommendations given to me by current coaches/TA's (and people I observe doing this myself) plus students who get high grades in the course.*

* How much are you connected with what goes on in lab? I know you said that you don’t know the specific details, but let’s say if I had a question about an experiment, would you be able to answer it for me or would I have to go to a TA? 

*I can absolutely answer questions about experiments.*


* Will we have to study wind resistance?

*We can talk about it! The difficulty with wind resistance is that it is a force that depends on the object's velocity. Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity and forces cause acceleration, 
we're left with circular mathematical reasoning: the way that velocity changes (force/acceleration) depends on the way that velocity changes! This sort of circular reasoning involving rates of change
is called "differential equations". We'll dip our toe in this pond this semester, but won't go swimming fully in it quite yet. 

However, there's another way to understand wind resistance -- using a computer! You can approximate the velocity as constant during little intervals of time, and use the kinematics we already know
combined with Newton's second law to figure out what is going on, one little bit of time at a time. This is called "Euler's algorithm"; if you've seen Hidden Figures, it's mentioned in there as
something Katherine is using. It's a real thing, and you can use it to figure out how an object moves with air drag.*

* Will the homework packets be with the lab worksheets in the physics clinic?

*You can read them on your computer, but we can print some out for you and put them in the clinic if you want. Would that be useful?*

* Will we get the opportunity to work with different groups in recitation/lecture?

*Yep! We plan to change the groups after every recitation.*

* How much calculus do we need to know? Do we need to know trigonometry for this course as well?
* I am concerned with only being in calc 1 right now. In recitation there is already material that I don't understand because I haven't yet learned it in calc. 
* My concern is that I’m currently taking calculus 1 this semester… will I still be well suited to pass this class? 
* Should I be ok in this class since I haven’t finished (currently taking) Calc 1?

*The only calculus we expect you to know is what we've already done: deducing how an object's velocity and position change from a description of its acceleration,
or vice versa. If you're just now taking calculus, don't worry -- you'll be fine. We've had students ace this class who weren't taking calculus at all.

The bouncing basketball problem from last Friday is subtle and HARD, and challenges even TA's and coaches sometimes. If you understand the bicycle problem on HW1 and
the rocket problem on this Wednesday's recitation, you're in good shape.*

* I missed the first week of lectures due to not being able to register for classes and would like help catching up. 

*We can definitely help you! The best thing for you to do would be to come to the Physics Clinic and work on HW1; we will work alongside you and help you learn things
that you missed in the context of these problems.*

* Everything seems pretty clear so far. I think the main thing would be if the physics clinic will have different hours throughout the semester ?

*My hours will vary based on when I think people will need the most help, but the Clinic's hours in general will stay the same -- unless you want TA's or coaches
at other times, in which case I'll see what I can do.*

* Will we be using the giant newton ball thing

*Yup!*

* Not questions.but more of going over equations would help a ton

*We'll be doing a lot more sample problems in class starting tomorrow.*

* On average, how much time should be spent on each homework assignment? 
* How long should it take to complete the homework's?
* How much homework do we get in an average week? 

*We anticipate that you'll spend, on average, four hours on our homework a week. But that may vary a lot. In general, you'll have a homework set of around seven problems assigned every week or week-and-a-half.*


* In class you said that we don’t really go over the textbook so what are some resources that allow us to better understand the topics discussed in class. 
* What are the best ways to study the course material outside of completing recitation packets and homework?
* Will there be any extra material I can use to study for tests/exams?
* What resources would you recommend for extra help besides the TAs and office hours?
* What would you say is the best way to study for the exams? 

*My experience is that rather than doing a huge number of problems by rote, it's better to study fewer exercises and really understand them. All the homework and recitation exercises are constructed so that
if you understand them, you're in good shape. As a guideline, if you ever feel like you are "doing the same thing over and over again" -- if all the exercises we do seem like manifestations of the same
few basic concepts -- you understand well.

"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." --Bruce Lee

If you want more resources, the best extra resources we have for you in this class are the* **human** *ones: the coaches in recitation, the Physics Clinic, and
the community of your peers and instructors on Discord. I believe our coach Sydney Jud is uploading some solutions to recitations on her YouTube channel ("Sydney Explains Stuff"). If you like videos, she 
does a good job of, well, explaining stuff. You can always ask me, too. If you like to read, the textbook is pretty good. But most people learn best by conversation, and we've got lots 
of opportunities set up for you to have conversations.

We'll also have a practice exam before each exam and a review session.*


* Homework is turned in on paper, to recitation? Do they go over it on recitation? We have to do one problem on each page?
* How is hw submitted? Or do we just do that on our own and base it on trust that everyone is doing what they need to?
* Do we have to print out the homework every week or can we do the problems on loose leaf?
* So NONE of the work for this course will be submitted online other than the check-ins? (such as projects or homework - all homework will be turned in on paper in recitation?)
* Should we attach the homework questions to our homework when we hand it in?

*Yep! You'll turn your homework in at recitation. You don't have to print out the problems; we already know what they are. :) We prefer for you to do one problem per side, but that isn't an absolute;
just don't squish things together and try to smash everything on one page. None of the work will be online, except the checkins.*

* Is there any way we could have a complete list of due dates for homework and such?

*We don't know yet, since we'll adapt this to your progress. If there's a particular purpose you have for asking this, or something you need to know in particular, let me know.*

* Do you enjoy teaching physics?

*I have the best job on campus. :)*

* How does this course prepare us for PHY 212?

*This class is a study of forces and motion, but soon we will discover that an idea called "energy" underpins a lot of the way we analyze moving objects. In PHY212 you will learn about new forces -- 
electricity and magnetism -- and use your old ideas from PHY211 about vectors, kinematics, energy, geometry, and so on to analyze them.*

* Will exams be taken in the auditorium, or will we split up into different rooms?
* Will the exams be held online?

*All the exams will be in the auditorium; you will have assigned seats. They will be with good old fashioned pencils on good old fashioned paper.*

* Are YouTube videos recommended if we need assistance outside of the physics clinic hours?

*Sure, if that helps you! The only ones I can personally recommend are the ones Sydney Jud (our coach) makes on her channel. I'm not familiar with all of the various physics YouTubers out there.*

* Where can I find the pre-lab to print.

*There are copies in the back of the lab handouts that you can pick up from the Physics Clinic.*

* What types of calculators are we allowed to have? I have a TI-84, is that ok?

*Any calculator that won't do algebra for you is okay on exams.*

* Zoom office hours please

*I won't be having office hours on Zoom, but I can help people on Discord if you want help over the internet.*

* What's Walter's favorite movie?

*Hmm... that's a good one. It varies, but I'm fond of the Lord of the Rings trilogy (although the books are better), Contact (adapted from Carl Sagan's book, which is better), Serenity, 
and October Sky (which I need to see again). TV shows? I like Firefly, Doctor Who, Battlestar Galactica, West Wing, and Newsroom, to name a few.*

* How will the group exams and the note sheet for the exams specifically work?

*On the Friday before the exam your group will get two exam-style questions to do. Each recitation section will have different questions. Then, at the end of the day Friday, you'll get 
all of them put together as a practice exam. We'll create solutions to those together during a weekend review session. The note sheet is just an 8.5x11" piece of paper that you can 
write stuff on.*

* How hard is the torque unit going to be 

*Many students find it quite challenging, but it doesn't need to be; it is easy to overthink things, and it is also something where you have to think deeply before "just doing math". 
It is a good challenge, though -- it teaches you to understand and reason, while also understanding things like bicycle gears and Yo-Yos.*

* Why do you like teaching physics?

*My grandfather grew up without electricity on a farm in Illinois before penicillin was invented. He saw the Dust Bowl destroy the fertility of the land in the Midwest, and devoted his career to ensuring that wouldn't
happen again. My mother saw people fly to the Moon when she was your age. I saw the emergence of the Internet as a child. My grandfather lived
to see a time when he could access the sum total of human knowledge with a smartphone in seconds. What a life -- and what an advancement in human capacity!

When I am in class I am surrounded by the people who will make tomorrow better than yesterday, and by being a small part of your education I can contribute to 
that advancement.

I also like teaching physics because it is a perspective that is profoundly empowering and beautiful. I love seeing young folks find beauty and power, in equal measure, in
understanding how our world works.*

* Along with the slide shows, can you provide videos of the material you think would be helpful and/or some sort of study guide with various concepts?

*I don't have any videos in my back pocket. I do have some overview guides for some topics in our course, and I could write more if people want them. However,
the best study practice you can have is to *do* things, not to read or watch them. The homework and recitation exercises are pretty comprehensive.*

* Why is physics the field you chose to get into? Did you want to teach Phys101? Do you still enjoy it?

*I love teaching this class. It is very nuts and bolts, but nature is made of nuts and bolts, and it is a great joy to share this with you all. 
It's my second-favorite class to teach here; my favorite is computational physics, where we apply computational methods and computer simulations to this material.
I wanted to go into physics because it is in some sense
the universal explainer: somewhere beneath any "So why does this work this way?" question is the stuff of physics."*

* May there please be a point in recitation when problems are reviewed together as a class? It solidifies one's learning. (so work problems as a group, then come back together as a class when needed to go over the problem.)

*Ask your TA to do this, if you want! Some TA's have chosen to do a mini-recap at the end of recitation.*

* Will there be any quizzes during class or recitations?

*Other than the group exams in recitation (before each exam, as practice), no.*

* What are small practices we can use that physicists have used to understand fundamental forces more accurately?

*I'll give you three. (1) Always looking to experimental data and empirical observation as the highest authority in science; (2) Trying to find underlying principles that explain diverse phenomena (for instance, 
if you apply the mechanics we are learning to atoms, you understand a great deal about chemistry and thermodynamics), (3) Looking for symmetries that occur in nature, and places that they are broken*

* when is the final? I already forget :(

*May 11, 3-5 PM. I had to look at <https://walterfreeman.github.io/phy211/calendar.html> and you can too!*

* Would you like to modify the grading system as percentage instead of points?

*I'm trying the "point" thing for the first time this year. It works the same but I think it is more transparent when people want to calculate their grades.*

* Is attendance recorded, and do you record lectures?

*In recitation yes. We will record lectures only if there is a lot of demand from people who are in isolation. However, recitation is approximately a bazillion times more important than lecture for your learning.
Skip lecture if you must; don't skip recitation.*

* If I am unavailable to attend the Physics Clinic, am I still able to collaborate with others or will that count as an academic integrity violation?

*You may ALWAYS collaborate with others and we encourage it extremely highly. The homework is not to test you; it is an exercise for you to learn from. The things you may not do 
on your homework are: (1) turn in things you don't understand or that you have copied from someone else, or (2) solicit or copy solutions from Chegg or similar websites. But we 
highly, highly encourage you to collaborate!*

* Is an A an 80 because the class is that hard? Do people get higher than 90's ever?

*Yes they do. There are very high grades in our class (around 100% sometimes). We ask you to do quite challenging things on exams; we figure if you can do 80% of challenging things on the spot
during exam conditions, you are damn good at physics and your grade should reflect it. The 90%=A grading scheme is peculiar to American 
high schools and is all about asking you to do easy things perfectly. Most places around the world don't do that.*

* will assignments be announced in email or do we have to keep track of them 

*I'll post the due dates on the website and announce them in class. But I won't be sending out "hey, your homework is due!" emails. You get enough spam already.*

* Is there a way to test out of the course if we have already taken a high level physics class?

*No; that's a decision above my pay grade. I just teach classes, not decide what you need to take for your program of study! However, if you want to do something more challenging in our class,
come talk to me.*
