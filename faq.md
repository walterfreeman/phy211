<a id="help"></a>
#### [How can I contact folks for help?](#help)

The best places to get help are:

* the Physics Clinic, room 112, where you can find other students from our class and a GTA tutor, and often me and coaches;
* the course Discord server, <https://discord.gg/bngYwjZRHk>, where you will often get immediate help and conversation with your colleagues and instructors
* your recitations, which are set up to provide you extensive support for our class

Other ways you can get help are:

* contact me by email at <wafreema@syr.edu>. Note that I get a lot of mail; I may not write you back right away. I will prioritize answering questions
about physics where I can help people learn.

* come visit me in my office, room 215 (I might be there)


<a id="hwturnin"></a>

#### [How do I turn in my homework?](#hwturnin)
Give it to your recitation TA at the beginning of recitation. Make sure that:

* you have put your name on your work 
* you have stapled it
* you have done each problem on a separate side of paper (so two problems are on each sheet of paper, one front and one back)

We won't accept homework submitted by email. If you must miss recitation for a good reason (perhaps if you are
in isolation for COVID-19), make arrangements with your TA to turn in your homework when you return.

<a id="clinic"></a>

#### [What and where is the Physics Clinic?](#clinic)

The Physics Clinic is room 112. It's where we hold our help sessions, but at other times you can find a tutor there as well.

You will likely find people working on the same homework as you if you go there, and you can work together!

<a id="contact"></a>
#### [Who's teaching this class, what do they all do, and how do I contact them?](#contact)

The **professor** is Walter Freeman (<wafreema@syr.edu>, room 215). I give the lectures, write material, 
maintain the website, help students learn physics in any other way I can, help grade exams, and 
lead the course as a whole. You can email me, find me before or after class, or come to help hours 
in the Physics Clinic. I'm also in my office.

Contact me if:

* You have a question about physics
* You have a suggestion that will improve the course as a whole or the lecture portion specifically
* Something is badly wrong in recitation that your recitation TA can't fix
* You will miss an exam
* You need high-level assistance with anything

The **recitation teaching assistants** are PhD students in physics who work as junior instructors as part of their training. They are in charge of leading recitations, grading homework, and grading exams.
They also hold help hours in the Physics Clinic.


Contact the recitation TA's if:

* You have a question about physics
* You have a suggestion that will improve their recitation, or that you want them to pass on to us
* Something is wrong with your homework or exam grade
* You will miss a recitation

The **undergraduate coaches** are undergraduate students like yourself who took this class in the past. They are in charge of helping you learn physics in your recitations.

Talk to the undergraduate coaches if:

* You have a question about physics
* You want advice on studying (they were in your shoes pretty recently and can give the best advice of any of us!)

<a id="book"></a>
#### [How do I get the textbook, and do I need it?](#book)

The book is *University Physics Volume 1* (W. Moebs, S. Ling, J. Sanny, et al.), published by OpenStax. This is an open-access textbook available to anyone under the terms of the CC-BY 4.0 license and can be <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-1">downloaded for free</a>. 

You'll need the book; we want you to read it ahead of class to ensure you're familiar with the concepts beforehand, and we'll ask you some short questions on Blackboard before lecture. We will skip around
in the book in order to present things in an order that makes things easier to learn.

---
<a id="math"></a>
#### [What math skills will I need?](#math)

You'll need to know how to:

* relate graphs to the functions they represent
* use the quadratic formula
* deduce missing angles/sides from right triangles using trigonometry
* solve a system of equations using substitution

That's it.

---
<a id="firstphysics"></a>

#### [This is my first physics class! Will I do okay?](#firstphysics)

This class is designed for people who've never had a physics class before, so you're in the right place. While many of your classmates have had high school physics, 
many students who do well in PHY211 have never taken physics before. Statistics from last year show that while students who took non-AP physics in high school *did* do
better on Exam 1, their advantage disappeared as the semester went on.

If this is your first physics class, make sure you ask us for help if you don't understand things, especially in the first unit. (This is good advice for everyone, of course.)

---
<a id="objectives"></a>
#### [What will be learning?](#objectives)

After each unit, the skills you should gain are:

* Unit 1 (Kinematics):
  * Translate between verbal, graphical, algebraic, and numerical descriptions of an object's motion
  * Given a description of an object's acceleration, create a description of how its position and velocity change, or vice versa
  * Use vectors to describe motion in two and three dimensions, and use trigonometry to manipulate them
  * Incorporate physical units (meters, seconds, and so on) into algebraic and arithmetic statements

* Unit 2 (Forces):  
  * Identify the forces that act on the objects present in a variety of physical situations
  * Describe the basic properties of the forces of tension, friction, gravity, and normal forces
  * Using Newton's second law, construct mathematical relations between those forces and the objects' motion
  * Identify constraints on those forces and on objects' motion based on Newton's third law and the geometry of the situations at hand
  * Describe the forces required to cause an object to move in uniform circular motion
  * Use the previous skills to predict how an object will move in any given situation, and the forces involved in its motion

* Unit 3 (Conservation laws)  
  * Use conservation of momentum to solve problems that involve collisions and explosions
  * Use the work-energy theorem and conservation of energy to determine properties of the motion of systems to which they apply, and recognize which systems those are

* Unit 4 (Rotation)
  * Construct analogies between the properties of rotational motion and the properties of translational motion
  * Use conservation of energy to solve problems in which objects rotate as well as translate
  * Describe the relationship between the forces that act on an object and the torque they apply about any given axis
  * Describe the relationship between the torque applied to an object and its angular acceleration
  * Use both $\vec F=m\vec a$ and $\tau = I \alpha$ in tandem to predict the motion of objects that both translate and rotate
<!--
* Throughout (Process of Science)
  * Describe the basics of scientific integrity and the properties of both honest scientific arguments and dishonest pseudoscientific claims
  * Critique (pseudo)scientific claims that are made in bad faith, and describe the problems with them
  * Critically examine sound and unsound scientific claims that seek to overturn preexisting consensus. In particular:
    * Describe the primacy of empirical measurements in evaluating scientific claims
    * Critique flawed arguments that fail to address empirical data 
    * Critique flawed arguments that fail to address the broader framework of physical laws of nature
    * Critique flawed arguments that focus on the identities of the people involved, rather than their data and logic

<a id="grades"></a>
#### [How will grades be calculated?](#grades)

The various parts of the course count as follows:

| Item                         |            Date           | Points            |
|------------------------------|:-------------------------:|------------------:|
| Homework                     | Due throughout            |        Around 30 each; around 240 in total  |
| Exam 1                       | 25 February               |             100   |
| Exam 2                       | 14 March                  |             100   |
| Exam 3                       | 29 April                  |             100   |
| Final Exam                   | 19 May, 3PM-5PM           |             160   |
| Recitation participation     | Throughout the semester   |              5 each; around 140 in total   |
| Weekly checkins              | After each week           |      5 each; around 70 in total |
| Group practice exams         | Prior to each exam        |              50 each; 150 in total  |

* The first time you miss a group practice exam, its grade will be replaced with the same percentage you earn on the corresponding individual exam, if you
missed the group practice exam for an excused reason.
To do this, you must tell your TA why you missed the group exam, and do so in advance if possible. You must also
tell your group that you will be absent -- this is a professional courtesy to them!

* Your lowest homework set grade, your lowest weekly check-in, and your four lowest recitation participation days will be dropped.  

Note however that students with an unusually low recitation participation grade for any given unit, or
who demonstrate that they don't understand this material on the final, will not be eligible to drop the
corresponding exam at our discretion. (Basically: if you bomb an exam, it won't count against you
*if and only if* you make sure you learn that material before the final.)

At the end of the term, we will assign you a letter grade based on the percentage you have earned, as follows:


- A : >88
- A-: 80-88
- B+: 75-80
- B : 70-75
- B-: 65-70
- C+: 62-64
- C : 58-62
- C-: 55-58
- D : 50-55
- F : less than 50

<a id="gradecorrection"></a>
#### [What if there is an issue with my grades?](#gradecorrection)


If you don't believe the grades on something are correct:

* Talk to your TA sometime *other* than when they're teaching recitation; their clinic hours are a great place to do this.

* Notify us within a week of when we post those grades to Blackboard.

* If there is something wrong with the arithmetic of your grade (we added numbers wrong, or we mistyped something in Blackboard), we'll fix it right there with no fuss. (Sorry!)

* Otherwise, before hearing your grade appeal, the TA may ask you to solve the problem on your own on the board, without notes. If you're going to appeal your grade for something, the least you can do is to go back and figure out the solution!

* Your grade will still be based on what you originally wrote down on your homework/exam

* We'll regrade the whole problem from scratch; it *is* possible for your grade to go *down* if it turns out the original grader made a mistake and gave you a grade that's too high.

* The grades for answers with no clear explanation given (text or well-organized algebra that explains itself)
are not subject to appeal.

<a id="hwgrades"></a>
#### [How will homework be graded?](#hwgrades)

We'll choose two problems out of each homework set. These will be graded fully, out of ten points, for correctness. 

Note that you must *explain your reasoning* in solving the homework problems. Solutions consisting only of algebra that isn't self-explanatory will not get full credit even if they are correct.

Solutions consisting of a bunch of numbers, substituted into the algebra before you're ready to extract physical meaning from them, *certainly* won't get full credit.

The other problems will be graded simply for completeness, quickly getting a grade of 0 (not attempted seriously), 1 (partial answer), 2 (complete answer whether correct or not).

---
<a id="recgrades"></a>
#### [How will recitation participation be graded?](#recgrades)

Each day your TA will give you a grade from 0 to 3:

* 0: absent or not working to learn physics during most of recitation
* 1: present, but not working to learn physics during a large portion of recitation
* 2: present and working to learn physics, but not working with your group
* 3: present and working with your group so that both you and they learn the material

Your lowest four recitation grades will be dropped. If you miss more than four recitations, you should come talk
to me about broader accommodations. 

Remember that the most important aspect of recitation is your learning of physics, not the participation grade itself.
 

---
<a id="checkins"></a>
#### [How do these checkins work?](#checkins)

Every week on Friday I will post a Google Form with some questions checking in on you to see how you're doing.
After your recitation on Friday, 
please answer them before Monday at noon (it should take you five minutes at most). There are no correct or
incorrect answers here -- this is a way for you to give us feedback about how the course is going. Give us 
useful feedback to earn your credit.

---
<a id="lab"></a>
#### [Do we have lab this week?, and other lab questions](#lab) 

The lab is a different class. Ask your lab TA (different from your recitation TA) or Sam Sampere about it. You can of course ask any of us about the *physics* of what you do in lab.

You can also ask on the Discord server, where your peers will likely know more than I do.

---
<!--<a id="paper"></a>
#### [What about this paper?](#paper)

We'll also be talking about the nature of science in our class: 

* What is science? What is its history?
* How does it differ from other ways of knowing about our world?
* How do things try to imitate science in order to try to deceive others?
* How does the process of science sometimes go wrong?

We'll assign a paper about this. You can read last year's assignment <a href="paper.html">here</a>. (This will change slightly but not that much as we're getting ready to assign it.) You'll 
have a couple of weeks to write it. If it's good, you'll get a high grade. If it's *great*, you may get over 100%. If it's plagiarized, you'll fail the class and get in worse trouble than that. 
(Don't do this.)

<a id="exams"></a>
#### [When are our exams?](#exams)

|------------------------------|:-------------------------:|
| Group Exam 1                 |    11 February            |
| Exam 1                       |    15 February            |
| Group Exam 2                 |    4 March                |
| Exam 2                       |    10 March               |
| Group Exam 3                 |    8 April                |

<a id="calculator"></a>
#### [Do I need a calculator for the exams? What kind?](#calculator)


You may use a calculator to do arithmetic, evaluate trigonometric functions, and so on. In general, you may use any
"scientific" or "graphing" calculator, but may not use a calculator that will do symbolic manipulation (i.e. do
algebra for you).

If you do not have a calculator, you may leave your answers in symbolic form (i.e. "10 meters * cos 20 degrees").

---
<a id="cdr"></a>
#### [I take my exams at CDR. What do I need to do?](#ods)

Register with ODS to take your exam there. We'll send a PDF over. (You don't need to notify us. We do this all the time.)

Most students with disabilities should still be able to take their *group exams* in recitation, since most disabilities can be accommodated by the presence of other group members. If 
this for some reason doesn't work for you, please let us and ODS know.

If you need an alternate format exam (large print, etc.), please let us know in advance.

---
<a id="latehomework"</a>
#### [I'll be late turning in my homework. What do I need to do?](#latehomework)

Tell your recitation TA why you need an extension and when you'll have it done by. If they are okay with this,
then they'll make arrangements with you to turn it in late. Don't turn your homework in to your TA's mailbox
unless they tell you to.

---
<a id="absenceclass"></a>
#### [I need to miss a lecture. What do I need to do?](#absenceclass)

If you are in COVID isolation, we will make arrangements based on how many other students are in isolation. 
This may include making recordings of elements of class and sending them to you or arranging for alternative
means for you to learn the material. 

The most important thing to stay caught up with is the _recitations_, not the lectures. If you are in isolation,
download the recitation materials yourself and work on them during your recitation period along with any other
students who are in isolation over Discord. Ask for help; we will arrange for our coaches and TA's to help you
over Discord.

---
<a id="absencerec"></a>
#### [I need to miss recitation. What do I need to do?](#absencerec)

Let your TA know in advance if possible. 
Make arrangements to make up the practice you'll miss (we post all the recitation material).
If you are in COVID isolation, do the recitation problems on your own at home and ask questions
on Discord. There will almost certainly be someone available to help you.

Let your group know out of courtesy, and remember we drop your four lowest participation grades.

---
<a id="absencegroup"></a>
#### [I need to miss a group exam. What do I need to do?](#absencegroup)

If your absence is for a good reason, let your TA know. We'll give you the same grade you get on the main exam for your group exam, as well.

---
<a id="absenceexam"></a>
#### [I need to miss an exam. What do I need to do?](#absenceexam)

If your absence is for a good reason, let the professors know as much in advance as possible. We'll make arrangements with you.
