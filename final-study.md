I will also ask you a set of basic questions that will require only very brief calculations (i.e. one step). To do these, you will need only to know the definitions and dimensions of the things we've studied this semester.

You should be familiar with the *dimensions of*, and the *meaning of*, the following ideas:

* Position, velocity, acceleration
* Force
* Kinetic energy, work, power (rotational and translational)
* Moment of inertia
* Angular momentum
* Torque


### Study advice

So, how should you study for the final exam?

There are lots of ways to study. You may have your own preferred approach, which I'd advise you to first look at the above list of ideas and see if there are any that you feel you need to review. Note that I've divided the list of skills into Units 1-4, and then
again by the different skills you'll need. Once you've figured out what you want to focus on, take a look at each of the example problems I've suggested. Make sure you know the solutions to all of them; if you don't, come to the Physics Clinic or one of my review
sessions and ask.

Then, ask yourself two questions about that set of examples:

* What did they all have in common? What is the common approach you used to solve them all?
* What are the differences? What aspect of each problem makes it unique, challenging, or different from the others?

The idea here is to work toward a point where you are able to see all of the different examples as just different manifestations of the same basic principle. Remember the axiom "If you ever feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again, then that means you understand."

This process -- of seeing the things we've done as variations on a few basic themes -- will give you a flexible and enduring understanding of the material that will serve you well on the final and beyond.

If you come to one of the reviews that I'm doing, I will go through this process with you -- if, for instance, you say "Let's do all of Unit 1", I will work through it with you. 

It is also a good idea to do this with friends. Sit down with them over lunch or dinner, choose a topic, and talk through what the examples have in common and how you approached them.

Then, once you're done, go back and look at the practice exams for units 1-3. Look at each question and classify it: "Which skills do I need here, and how is this problem similar to the other examples? How is it different?"
