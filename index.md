### Current homework 

<a href="hw/hw1/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a> (your first "proper" homework set) is due Thursday night or Friday in recitation. 

Your 0th homework assignment is to answer a short set of questions about your math background.
This will let us help you better in our class, both in general and as part of the focused assistance
program.

Optionally, you may tell us a little about yourself.

The typo present in Question 4 originally has been fixed. If you answered the survey before we fixed
it, don't worry about doing it again.

It will take you about half an hour to complete. The 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1L2nFRb4D2kwFbkUouQQsEbjN9ZMbEogMW5NICYUluqU/">survey is available as a Google Form</a>.
