  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Here are the <a href="w2q.html">previous week‚Äôs questions</a>.</p>

<p>Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to ask or tell us?</p>

<ul>
  <li>What type of questions should we expect on the exam? (Circular motion, inclined plane, pulley system?)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>You can expect to analyze things involving circular motion, multiple objects linked together (with pulleys, for instance), things
on inclines, and to interpret how forces produce effects in accelerating systems (like ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt the frog fall out of the bucket‚Äù).
I will try to make the algebra not so hard.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>If the group exam is on Wednesday and the test is on Thursday, will all the questions for the Group Exam be released in time for us to look at them and study them?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Yes. I‚Äôll post full questions and video solutions as soon as each group is done taking their exam.</em>(</p>

<ul>
  <li>I wish the physics clinic was open later- i usually have classes all day and can‚Äôt get physics help. especially next week with the test and homework due so early</li>
</ul>

<p><em>We‚Äôre working to get coaches available to help people later this week!</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you posting a new sitting chart for this exam or is it going to be the same for the rest of the semester?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>It‚Äôll be a new chart.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Not really, may I take the exam during the 11 am one as I am used to waking up late.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Unfortunately we can‚Äôt do that, since the 11AM section is full ‚Äì you‚Äôd have to sit in someone‚Äôs lap‚Ä¶</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>not really lol, still havent slept so still kinda dying but thats pretty standard at this point üòÖ</li>
</ul>

<p><em>GO SLEEP. It‚Äôs more helpful than staying up studying (really)!</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Can the coaches explain how to complete problems more? when i ask in recitation, i do not know how to complete problems. Usually, they will tell me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the right track‚Äù, but sometimes i literally do not know where to go from there.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Does this mean you‚Äôre having trouble with the algebra? In that case, explain to the coaches what remaining aspect you are still stuck on.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>If before the exam, recitation solutions were posted like the homework solutions that would be awesome!</li>
</ul>

<p><em>They are! See the solutions page. You can also find them on Sydney‚Äôs YouTube channel ‚Äì google ‚ÄúSydney Explains Stuff‚Äù.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Will we get a formula sheet for this exam?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Yep! Same as before, one side of a page with whatever you write on it.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Will universal gravitation be on the exam?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Perhaps, but there is nothing difficult I can ask about it.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Elden ring?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Not yet. :)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>It would be really nice to get HW4 back on Wednesday so we can study what we got wrong</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I‚Äôve posted solutions to HW4, written by one of your colleagues.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Just thought to inform you that i have a midterm right before our exam in case i was late</li>
</ul>

<p><em>No worries! Ack ‚Äì what class is that? If you‚Äôre a little late you can have extra time.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Is it possible to get the exam review problems a few days before the exam( like the one we had for exam 1)?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The schedule is a little wacky here since we have to have the exam on a Thursday. But I‚Äôd suggest that HW4 and HW5 are plenty of review
between them, along with the things you‚Äôve done in recitation.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>I have a suggestion about group exams in the future. The first one was very chaotic and stressful and a bad experience overall. I suggest that maybe everyone gets their own exam to submit, but they can still check with their group and work with them. I felt like most of the time went into copying our answers onto the answer sheet.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This is how we wanted to do it last time. We had a catastrophe with the printers last time, which is why we‚Äôre not counting that one at all. This one everyone will have their own paper.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>How was your week?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Kinda crummy. :) But spring break is coming up!</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Having a homework due the week of a test is very stressful. The physic clinic is also hard get help in because there is such limited coaches to help us.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>We‚Äôre trying to get more folks to help in the Physics Clinic, but you can always ask your classmates! ‚ÄúHey, is anyone else working on #4?‚Äù
I‚Äôm also intending that working on HW5 will be the studying you need to do: you won‚Äôt need to study that material separately since, well,
it‚Äôs on the homework.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>I recall that the worst test grade would be dropped; does it include the final as well?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Partially. If your final exam grade is your lowest exam, it will only count half as much.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>I was absent all of last week due to COVID and am very worried about the exam.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>You can take a makeup. See me for details.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Last exam I was slightly overwhelmed and stressed with my seat being in the very center. I was wondering if there was any possibility to be placed on the end of a row to use the stairs as a bearing. I completely understand that there are not many end spaces available and if this is not able to happen. Thanks so much for all the help from each coach, TA, and professor.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I‚Äôll see what I can do!</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>How long is Walter‚Äôs hair</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Too damn long.</em></p>
