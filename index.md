### Upcoming events:

* <a href="hw/hw5/hw5.pdf">Homework 5</a> is now available. It is due Monday, March 29, by the end of the day. 

* During this Wednesday's recitation, we would like you to look at the <a href="group-exam-2-prep.pdf">scenarios for Group Exam 2</a> with your group and discuss them. You may also discuss Problems 3 and 7 from HW5 with your group, 
* During Friday's recitation, you will take a group practice quiz. This will count for a (reduced) grade, but will also serve as a good practice for the individual quiz happening next Tuesday. We will ask you two questions. (Different recitation sections will get different ones.) You will see the specific questions your group will get at the beginning of recitation Friday.
