## General
* In order for the recitation to be useful and effective, please come to recitation prepared.
Specifically, this means that you have attended lecture, looked anything up in the text
you didn't understand and/or asked someone about it, 
and looked at homework that has been assigned recently. You
will be working in groups, and if you have fallen too far behind you are hindering
both yourself and your groupmates.
* To make the most of our time together in recitation, please ask any
questions that you have regarding things covered in lecture, reading assignments,
homework assignments, etc. Asking informed questions is essential to the goals we
have set for you in this course; the ability to reason physically is a process of inquiry,
and being able to ask good questions is, if anything, more important than knowing
all of their answers.
* Out of respect for your classmates and the course as a whole, students are expected
to be punctual (see section Attendance). Recitation sections will start at the time posted;
if you're late, you may miss things, including being counted present.
* The use of electronic devices (computers, laptops, tablets) is in general not allowed,
with the exception that you may use them to refer to course material.


## Attendance and Participation
* Attendance and participation are a component of your final grade. A sign in sheet
will be passed around at the beginning of recitation. At the TA’s discretion, students
arriving late may not receive credit for attendance.
* You are expected to participate actively in recitation activities. These include
 class discussions, group work, and presentations. Your recitation grade will be based
both on your attendance and on the quality of your contributions to your group and to the class.
* Before every exam, you will work on a preliminary exam in your groups. These preliminaries
serve both as practice exams for the in-class test and as group examinations,
and together they carry the same weight as one of the in-class exams.
  - If you must miss a group exam, notify your TA in advance. If you miss a group exam for an excused reason, your in-class exam grade will replace the group exam grade.  


## Homework
* Homework is due at the beginning of recitation. If your TA instructs you to submit
homework to their mailbox, you may do so, but do not do this without prior permission.
If extenuating circumstances prevent you from turning your homework in on
time, contact your TA well in advance of the due date to request an extension, which
will be granted at their discretion. Late homework without prior arrangement will
only be accepted in emergency situations.
* If you must be absent from recitation, contact your TA in advance to arrange to submit
your homework.
* You are encoraged to collaborate with your peers on your homework. However, you
must understand everything you turn in. Work that is so similar to another student’s
that it reflects wholesale copying, rather than collaboration, amounts to “substituting
someone else’s understanding for your own”, and will be treated as a violation of
the Code of Academic Integrity.
* Homework submissions should not consist only of algebra without accompanying
diagrams and discussion. This is not a mathematics class; do not simply submit
mathematics. Your solution to homework problems should be a short narrative, explaining
your complete thought process leading from the problem to the solution
using words, pictures, algebra, and numbers where appropriate. Words and diagrams
are just as important as symbols and numbers. 
* Any solution with numbers substituted for algebraic expressions prematurely will
lose up to half credit. This may seem harsh, but it is considerably simpler *and far
more illuminating!* to substitute in numbers only as the very last step of a problem,
unless there is specific physical insight to be gained by numerically evaluating expressions
sooner. In general, unless you are prepared to interpret a numerical value,
rather than simply compute it, leave it as an algebraic expression. This point will be
illustrated in class and further explained by your TA’s.
* Any final answer bearing dimensions (a mass or a length, for instance) without units
will be marked as incorrect.
* You are also expected to include units along with numerical dimensionful quantities
in your calculations. This will prevent you from making certain sorts of mistakes:
adding together a length and a mass, for instance. If you make this sort of mistake,
and if you would have caught the mistake had you carried the units along with your
numerical work, then you may lose credit for the entire problem. This may seem
harsh, but this requirement is there to encourage good habits. This will be discussed
further in class.
* If you have an objection to the grading of your homework, speak to your TA, as the
grader, first. Any student making a grade appeal must be prepared to solve the problem,
without notes, on the blackboard. If, after discussion with the TA, you still wish
to appeal your grade, speak to Walter or Ohana.

## Exam grade appeals
* If you believe that your exam grade is incorrect, speak to your recitation TA first. If
they agree with you, they may fix the mistake. If they disagree with you, they may
direct you to consult with Walter.

* As with homework, if you are appealing the grading of an exam problem, you must be prepared to solve
the problem on the blackboard.
