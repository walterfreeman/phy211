* Are there any coaches or TA's that have private tutoring hours?

All of the TA's hold hours in the physics clinic, and you're welcome to go visit them any time you like. If you and a group want to work with one of the coaches, figure out a time in advance and
let me know when, and I'll try to get someone there to help you. If you want to work one on one with someone, we'll do our best, but there are only so many of us.

* Can I get extra credit??
* Is there any extra credit available for those who really need it.

We don't have extra credit, but you will have an opportunity on the final exam to partially replace a low grade on your previous exams if you have learned the material by then.



* Can tele-portal exist in theory?

There are two sorts of teleport devices imagined in science fiction. One is a stable wormhole -- a shortcut through space and time that takes you from one place to another. This is _potentially_ possible, but nobody knows how to create one or to stabilize it, or what those solutions to the Einstein equations of general relativity would look like.

* Can there be a time allotted for people to prepare for exam 3 with a couple TAs where we keep doing practice problems, preferably set 1-2 days before the exam.

Potentially -- would you like this to be done Sunday? We could also do this Monday, the day before the exam.

* Can you explain the physics of black holes? I‚Äôve always been curious about how they work.

Sure! We can talk about that in class -- potentially Thursday or next week.

* can you pretty please with a cherry on top add a problem including Tom & Jerry (the old cartoon- i‚Äôm literally rewatching it right now and the last time I saw it was on a DVD player). and like cartoon physics- someone not falling until they look down, being flattened by a falling piano, small animals have superstrength. i will be forever in your debt in you add a tom and jerry problem. thank uüòÅ

This would be amazing! I did put a Wile E. Coyote question on an exam a while back... If you write a Tom and Jerry question, perhaps I shall use it :)

* Could we possibly record the review session for us to be able to remember what you say while going through. Specifically your thought process.

I can see if I can do that!

* Could you please go over the HW question about the penguin. Also, I would like to know how you would do that question of someone rubbing their hands together to create heat.

Sure! I'll do that in class tomorrow.

* Do you teach other physics courses? For example, if I were to continue down the current track would I be able to have you as a professor? I may consider it depending on the difficulty of the course and what the topics of learning are.

I teach whatever the department chair asks me to teach. :) In the fall I'll be teaching Astronomy 101, a large course for non-technical majors that focuses equally on the physical principles behind astronomy and on how astronomy has throughout history had a profound influence on humanity. I'll also be teaching Physics 525, an advanced undergraduate course on electrodynamics. In the past I have taught a 300-level course on computational physics that students can take right after PHY211. I hope to teach other stuff in the future -- I'd love to teach Physics 212 (the course after this one) and Physics of Music again.

* Does a lot of what we are learning right now carry over into courses like statics and dynamics?

Absolutely -- especially what we do at the end, on rotational motion. You can think of Statics and Dynamics as engineering courses that take the ideas we've explored and look at them with greater mathematical and problem-solving sophistication.

* Does your hair give you strength like Samson from the Bible? Or is it linked to your knowledge on physics? Do you feel like if you cut it you might lose some intellectual abilities or perhaps some physical abilities? I am just curious

It mostly tries to eat me while I sleep. In the fall, an ESF graduate asked me to be a groomsman in her wedding and to play the piano. She told me I could have at most one stick in my hair -- more than that would be too many, but I was allowed one stick. (I love hiking and the outdoors and stuff gets stuck in my hair all the time.)

* how can i properly learn physics? I still don't completely get it.

There is no "proper". And learning physics is difficult! It is difficult for me. But a few pointers:
- Physics doesn't involve the mastery of complex things; it involves the clever application of simple things. Figuring out what does and doesn't matter in a given situation and choosing the right approach is more difficult than actually executing that approach. In our class, a few bits of advice: 1) ask questions all the time (including during class and recitation), 2) look for similarities and big-picture ideas that apply across situations and exercises, 3) with each exercise, ask yourself: "How would I know what to do here?" We'll talk more about this in class tomorrow.

* how did you decide physics was your "thing"?

I had a really awesome physics teacher in middle school. But I have always been fascinated by how things work -- taking machines apart, and so on. What better thing to try to understand than the universe itself? I could potentially have become an engineer, but some childhood experiences with people in my hometown gave me an incorrect impression of what engineers did and who they were. I now have a great respect for engineers and sometimes wish I had become one!

* how difficult is the final exam?

Comparable to the previous exams -- but somewhat more "conceptual" (in that there will be questions that cut across the different subjects we have studied).

* How do massive boats like aircraft carriers float?

Great question! The best way to understand this is by thinking about energy. When things fall or sink, they are moving in a way that minimizes their potential energy. An object falling in vacuum -- that is obvious. But when an object floating in water sinks, submerging part of its volume, an equal volume of water must be lifted up. If the object is more dense than water (say, a stone), then the loss of potential energy of the stone "outweighs" (literally) the gain in potential energy of the water that is lifted up, and it falls. But a large ship is still mostly air on the inside; on average, it is less dense than water. So, for it to sink, it would lose a little potential energy -- but this is outweighed by the potential energy the water would gain, and it thus doesn't sink. A ship filled with water rather than air, obviously, has a higher density -- so it will sink. Some ships float very low in the water because they are quite dense (think the famous USS Monitor in the American Civil War); some of them can even control their density by exchanging water with air in tanks inside. This is how submarines control their depth. (Fish do this too!)

How do you keep your hair looking so good? lol

* I occasionally brush it. :) I know very little about taking care of hair -- our previous academic coordinator kept trying to tell me what "conditioner" is. Most of the time I brush my hair in the car on the way to class. :P

How does lightning work?

* Great question! Two things happen in lightning. First, the clouds accumulate an electric charge: they become negatively charged compared to the ground as moving water droplets and ice crystals in a storm cloud carry charge around. This means that the excess negative charge in the sky is attracted to the positive charge in the ground. But the electrons in the sky can't move downward, because air doesn't conduct electricity -- air molecules are neutral.

However -- it _does_ conduct electricity if the electric field is strong enough! A sufficiently strong electric field will rip the electrons off of atoms, leaving behind positively-charged ions and free electrons. These things *can* conduct electricity (they are electrically charged and free to move), and so a huge number of positive ions go up and free electrons go down, neutralizing the charge. They release an enormous amount of energy as they do so: a lightning bolt. The same thing happens on a smaller scale when there is a spark. This process of a previously-insulating thing becoming ionized and thus conducting is called "dielectric breakdown" -- ask your PHY212 class about the maximum energy a capacitor can store!


* How does oil rigs work?

I have no idea in detail! I know some oil pockets are under high pressure so you basically stick a tube in them and the oil comes out; in others, extraction operations force other fluids into the ground under high pressure and force the hydrocarbons (gas or oil) out.

* How does terminal velocity work?

Great question! We'll look at this in class tomorrow.

* How is physics related to chemical engineering?

Another great question! Chemistry is just the physics of atoms, so any mechanics that we learn will also explain a lot of chemistry when applied to atoms. I'll talk about this in class, perhaps, on Thursday (this one or next one).

* I have been having a bard time with power and momentum.

We will review this in class tomorrow! Please ask me any questions (about homework or recitation questions) then.

* I have taken physics before and enjoy the way you teach it - you do a great job making it easy to understand!

Thank you!

* I need help understanding when to use certain equations because I get confused because of that

This perhaps is because physics isn't about "equations" -- no more than the study of philosophy is the study of words. If you are having difficulty figuring out which equations to solve, then this is normal: this is the difficult part of physics. :)

* I think that as a seperate comment, not relfecting on my TA, Coaches, or Group members, there isn't enough time in recetation to get through with the recetation packets. Normally we get through about half of the packet, so whatever ends up being in the last question normally doesn't even get looked at, as we struggle through the first question. Recetation works well when the TAs do the problem on the board after we've looked at it, I feel as though I learn quite a bit that way, but we don't cover all of the material that way because of time constraint. Since break I feel as though my understanding of the material has decreased quite a bit becuase of this.

Thanks for letting us know about this! We include more exercises than many students will get through sometimes, since we know *some* students will finish the first ones early; when students aren't able to finish the things that we consider essential, generally we'll repeat one of those questions the next time. But we will simplify things in our last unit.

* I'd like to become a physics coach

Talk to me during my office hours! We'd like you to, too -- we are always looking to hire folks who are good at explaining stuff.

* I‚Äôve been thinking about why objects will seemingly randomly fall after being in the same position for awhile. Like my shampoo bottle wasn‚Äôt in the most steady position, but it stayed there for like 30 seconds. Then, when there was no change in the forces on it, it fell. Thinking with my physics brain, I would expect the object to immediately fall, or to never; how can it be delayed?

Great question! The short answer is that there must have been changes somehow in the forces on it; maybe something shifted underneath it, or the liquid in it settled, or something. These changes can be subtle. Sometimes the materials providing the normal force to support something gradually wear; this happens, for instance, when a screw pulls out of a wall over time and a picture frame it was holding up falls.

* If I am struggling with this course, is it likely I will be unable to grasp the material of future physics courses? I am really interested in the Quantum Mechanics and Stellar Astrophysics courses but I am worried that I may not have the capacity to learn their coursework to the extent I wish to. I also understand that if I put in enough time and effort I can learn, but with the intense schedule I will have I may not have the needed time to do so if I need as much help as I think I will. I also see physics as a something that can help me overcome the insecurities I have around my intelligence. A big part of being a STEM major was to prove to myself that I could learn and excel in a field I considered to be very difficult yet interesting!

Not at all -- I can definitely help you with this sort of thing. I had a great deal of test anxiety in grad school so I can totally sympathize. Please come chat during office hours this week and we'll figure out a path for you.

* Is it possible to end with a passing grade if I failed the first two exams?

Absolutely!

* Is physics 2 easier?

It involves perhaps less new material; it is the application of what you have learned this semester to some new things, in particular electrons. If you understand vectors, the work-energy theorem, and geometry, you're pretty much good to go for a lot of it.

* Is there any material that I can use to study better for next exam? I really want to pass my classes!

I wrote up a comprehensive set of notes for this unit that you can look at: see <a href="unit-3-review.pdf">the Unit 3 review</a>.

* is there past finals and exams posted of this class that we can use as reference or study guide?

The practice exams we use are designed for this. The final we gave last year was a disaster; we tried to do multiple choice and it was a giant mess. The final the year before was half multiple choice, but I can send you the long-answer problems.

* This is a very odd question (not really physics) that I‚Äôve had for years. What is the defining point between a cup and a bowl? Is it the shape? Does the rim need to be a certain amount bigger than the base? Is it based on what is put into it, as a bowl could just become a very big cup or vice versa? With that, is a mug a cup or a bowl with a handle? I love to hear others thoughts on this.

It is whatever people decide. :)

* What are some things in physics in general that you wish you could change? Not for this physical course but in the general field of physics.

The biggest one is the belief that physics is somehow inaccessible, arcane, intimidating, or frightening for "people who aren't geniuses". I think this is connected, in a sad way, to the way the world was introduced to the field of physics under that name -- when it was revealed in 1945 that physicists had designed the nuclear weapons used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. (Previous physicists, like Newton and Einstein, were primarily thought of as philosophers or mathematicians.) Ironically, physicists do not deserve as much of the credit for the Manhattan Project as they got: the physics aspect of a nuclear bomb is quite simple compared to the chemistry and metallurgy, but the US government didn't talk about those simply because those *are* the hard parts and they didn't want the USSR figuring them out.

But physics is not unapproachable or exclusive. It is also not the domain of "really hard mathematics"; it turns out that 90% of the really nifty things in physics consist of figuring out how to make clever approximations that capture the essence of a thing, but result in simple mathematics that people can do without too much difficulty.

* What are the requirements for minoring in physics or maybe getting a dual major? (I am currently majoring in aerospace engineering)

For a minor, you need to take PHY211 + PHY212 plus 4 other courses at the intermediate level (300+). For a major, you need to take PHY211 + six other courses; two of these are a class in modern physics (quantum mechanics and relativity) and a lab class. We have lots of electives, including working as a coach; you can also count some engineering courses toward a physics degree. Come talk to me for more info!

* What is the physics of oobleck(cornstarch and water mixture)? I don‚Äôt get how it works?

Most fluids have the same viscosity (degree of internal friction when they flow) regardless of how they are flowing. But some fluids, called "non-Newtonian fluids", are weird -- they have other properties because of their composition. I don't understand in detail why oobleck is one, but there is an entire section of our department (the Soft Matter Group) that studies stuff like this! Wikipedia has a writeup on it -- see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Newtonian_fluid#Oobleck .

* What is your recommended way for preparing for an exam? I‚Äôve attended the clinic, tutoring, lectures, and recitations and I still feel like insufficiently prepared for exams.


* What‚Äôs the percentage of people get B?

My guess is that we'll see 65-70% of the class earn a B- or better.

* What‚Äôs your favorite thing about physics, you can choose anything.

"There are holes in the rainbow; they tell us we are all made of stardust."

But I've answered this one before, so another one: physics has been the vehicle for the astoundingly rapid improvement in our standard of living and our understanding of the universe over the last 400 years. We now understand what the universe is made of, in astounding detail. I can look at the cup of water in front of me and think of the atoms dancing around inside, following Newton's laws of motion in response to the electric forces acting on them; the ones with enough kinetic energy to escape the surface tension at the top float into the air, evaporating; since they are the ones with more energy than average, the whole thing cools down as it evaporates. The stars in the sky are doing the same dance over millions of years, moving in response to gravity instead. It's an incredibly beautiful perspective on the world. Maybe a metaphor is appropriate: Music is beautiful, and listening to music is inspiring. But -- as a performer -- I would much rather be on stage. And when I listen to music, I can imagine what the performers are doing; when I watch a choir sing I know what it is like to be up there on stage and how the music is put together. It's the same for physics: I find the universe even more beautiful now that I know a little about how it works.

And, at the same time, this knowledge is useful! Imagine going up to someone a thousand years ago and saying to them: "There are lots of kinds of rocks, but I want to tell you about four. There is a very heavy kind of rock called pitchblende. If you refine it, you can extract nearly limitless energy from it. In the future, you will call the metal you refine from it uranium. You know lodestone -- the thing you use to navigate. You can use lodestone to create lightning from movement; other kinds of rocks can turn sunlight into lightning. You can trap the lightning in copper -- the thing you make pots out of. You know sand, of course. You can turn sand into another kind of metal, and if you trap lightning in it, you can make it think. And your descendents will use thinking-rocks to talk to one another around the world, and share pictures of their cats, and make another laugh, and show love to their beloveds across the oceans. And in the meantime you will discover that strong-light can let you see inside people to cure their ills and weak-light can let you send messages over miles..."

* Why do some MRI and CT scan machines need you to drink something to be a marker and others do not?

It's not the machines; it's what the doctors are trying to image. These substances are called "contrast"; they are often things that are very dense, and will absorb X-rays (used in a CT machine) or emit NMR radiation in a way that is very different from the surrounding tissue. For instance, if you want to image someone's intestines, having them drink barium will result in a great contrast between the barium and the surrounding intestinal tissue on the CT image.

* Why does diet coke fizz more on an airplane than on the ground ?

"Fizzing" happens when the carbonic acid dissolved in the Coke comes out of solution and becomes carbon dioxide gas. It stays in solution when the surrounding pressure is high (like in the pressurized can, which is greater than atmospheric pressure) and comes out of solution when that pressure is released. Well, in an airplane, the cabin is held at around 75% atmospheric pressure at sea level, so less pressure = more fizz!

* Will there ever be a problem where springs are related to momentum and is that something that would appear on an exam?

Yup! We'll do one tomorrow.

* would it be possible for the final to be optional in that it will only help you if you take it but won't hurt you?

You will need to take the final, sorry.



## Questions from earlier...



Is there anything else you'd like to ask or tell us? 

* What type of questions should we expect on the exam? (Circular motion, inclined plane, pulley system?)

*You can expect to analyze things involving circular motion, multiple objects linked together (with pulleys, for instance), things
on inclines, and to interpret how forces produce effects in accelerating systems (like "why doesn't the frog fall out of the bucket").
I will try to make the algebra not so hard.*


* If the group exam is on Wednesday and the test is on Thursday, will all the questions for the Group Exam be released in time for us to look at them and study them?

*Yes. I'll post full questions and video solutions as soon as each group is done taking their exam.*(

* I wish the physics clinic was open later- i usually have classes all day and can‚Äôt get physics help. especially next week with the test and homework due so early

*We're working to get coaches available to help people later this week!*

* Are you posting a new sitting chart for this exam or is it going to be the same for the rest of the semester? 

*It'll be a new chart.*


* Not really, may I take the exam during the 11 am one as I am used to waking up late. 

*Unfortunately we can't do that, since the 11AM section is full -- you'd have to sit in someone's lap...*

* not really lol, still havent slept so still kinda dying but thats pretty standard at this point üòÖ

*GO SLEEP. It's more helpful than staying up studying (really)!*

* Can the coaches explain how to complete problems more? when i ask in recitation, i do not know how to complete problems. Usually, they will tell me "I'm on the right track", but sometimes i literally do not know where to go from there. 

*Does this mean you're having trouble with the algebra? In that case, explain to the coaches what remaining aspect you are still stuck on.*

* If before the exam, recitation solutions were posted like the homework solutions that would be awesome! 

*They are! See the solutions page. You can also find them on Sydney's YouTube channel -- google "Sydney Explains Stuff".*

* Will we get a formula sheet for this exam? 

*Yep! Same as before, one side of a page with whatever you write on it.*

* Will universal gravitation be on the exam?

*Perhaps, but there is nothing difficult I can ask about it.*

* Elden ring?

*Not yet. :)*

* It would be really nice to get HW4 back on Wednesday so we can study what we got wrong 

*I've posted solutions to HW4, written by one of your colleagues.*


* Just thought to inform you that i have a midterm right before our exam in case i was late 

*No worries! Ack -- what class is that? If you're a little late you can have extra time.*

* Is it possible to get the exam review problems a few days before the exam( like the one we had for exam 1)?

*The schedule is a little wacky here since we have to have the exam on a Thursday. But I'd suggest that HW4 and HW5 are plenty of review
between them, along with the things you've done in recitation.*


* I have a suggestion about group exams in the future. The first one was very chaotic and stressful and a bad experience overall. I suggest that maybe everyone gets their own exam to submit, but they can still check with their group and work with them. I felt like most of the time went into copying our answers onto the answer sheet. 

*This is how we wanted to do it last time. We had a catastrophe with the printers last time, which is why we're not counting that one at all. This one everyone will have their own paper.*

* How was your week?

*Kinda crummy. :) But spring break is coming up!*

* Having a homework due the week of a test is very stressful. The physic clinic is also hard get help in because there is such limited coaches to help us. 

*We're trying to get more folks to help in the Physics Clinic, but you can always ask your classmates! "Hey, is anyone else working on #4?"
I'm also intending that working on HW5 will be the studying you need to do: you won't need to study that material separately since, well,
it's on the homework.*

* I recall that the worst test grade would be dropped; does it include the final as well? 

*Partially. If your final exam grade is your lowest exam, it will only count half as much.*

* I was absent all of last week due to COVID and am very worried about the exam.

*You can take a makeup. See me for details.*

* Last exam I was slightly overwhelmed and stressed with my seat being in the very center. I was wondering if there was any possibility to be placed on the end of a row to use the stairs as a bearing. I completely understand that there are not many end spaces available and if this is not able to happen. Thanks so much for all the help from each coach, TA, and professor. 

*I'll see what I can do!*


* How long is Walter‚Äôs hair

*Too damn long.*
